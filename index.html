One of the activist strategies that Ken touched on that struck me the most was the child to parent intergenerational education and connection. While watching this video and reflecting on my family, I can say that talking with my parents about the climate crisis has proven to be a successful strategy. 
<br><Br>

In the fall quarter of my freshman year of college, I decided to go vegan because of the environmental impacts animal agriculture has on the planet (Thanks Eng 22). When I told my parents, who are both vegetarian, they were both skeptics, but supportive. More than a year later my parents incorporate vegan meals more often in their life and often come to me with questions about ways to cut down the waste they are creating. Watching them grow into more conscious consumers has been a fun experience and has helped me improve my communication skills. 
<br><Br>


I think the reason why this approach works so well is because of love. Familial love, whether it is biologic or not, is deep and everlasting. It is the love for your family and wanting to give them the best chance possible in life that drives the changes. Moreover, in all approaches we embark on, I think we must remember the familial aspect of love and share it with others.

In response to you, I enjoyed reading about your personal experience, communicating with your parents to push forward the message of climate change while successfully incorporating a lifestyle change. I too have been able to open up the conversation of climate change with my parents, while they believe this to be a severe issue, like Ken mentioned what seems to be the most difficult part of even insinuating a change in the way I or they consume, is that of owning/buying less for the sake of our planet and not “directly” our own. In your particular case I am glad you were able to insight a change in your parents consumption apart from just your own.

<br><Br>

This is likely one of my favorite lecture videos because it touches on the fact that Western culture and our society tells us that buying more or quicker is equated to being more happy. In order for people to want better and or push towards creating lifestyle changes it is also our job to teach people why their consuming habits have negative impacts in the first place. This is why this issue overall is frustrating for me at times. While Ken’s generation has ignored the problem and has not taken accountability I often feel my own generation talks about how much others must be held accountable rather than in-sighting their own sustainable or more efficient practices. This isn’t to say that a majority of people aren’t doing anything proactive towards the issue of climate change, but I hear more complaints than I see action. Whether it’s shaming people for using plastic water bottles or re-iterating other’s negative habits, It isn’t often I hear others give each other direct advice rather than just “judging” them for their choices. I understand this method must work for some people, but theres simply so many actions or changes we can make ourselves before examining someone else’s path towards sustainability (that is, if they’re conscious about it). Again tying back to the idea of collective action, transferring that knowledge to a friend or parents I think becomes most impactful when you are able to explain a problem, offer a solution or “alternative action and explain why their choices will impact will have an affect on someone or something they love. An annoying process I think worth our time.
<br><hr>
After watching the first video and hearing Ken say that if we want to sustain our future we cannot wait any longer to act, I was curious to see what he would have to say after that. People often say the time to act is now, but suggest no specific actions, just a general command that really is not helpful. The child to parent intergenerational education strategy also seemed like a great idea to me, and although I have never realized it, I find that it happened naturally in my household. My mom is one of the least political people I know, however, she will always listen to what I have to say. She has told me that the majority of her political knowledge and opinions have come from me, which shows just how powerful this strategy can be. Now that I know that, I will be more conscious about what information I am giving her and how together we can become more environmentally friendly in various ways. It is amazing how you were able to educate your parents and even get them to make small changes that if more people did would add up to a huge impact.
<br><Br>

Unfortunately, I can see how this strategy may not be effective in certain situations. In my case, my mom had very little opinion on climate change before, so she is not likely to oppose my opinions. However, I know many people of the older generations do have opinions, many of them being climate change deniers, so I would assume their child would have a harder time getting them to start caring about their carbon footprint. Though they may have been part of the generation whose lifetime created three-quarters of the CO2 emissions, they may not care to address that. Even with that said and knowing this strategy may not work for every family, it can’t hurt to try. Expressing opinions and civilly debating can only benefit and educate both people involved, and it might even help mitigate the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I also agree that child to parent learning is so crucial and impact. Through conversations that parents have with their kids it sparks change as through hearing and seeing the reasoning behind each other's argument they both can see the validity in each other's opinion. But I know that from the small town I grew up in a large percent of the students in my grade did not believe in climate change because their parents said it was not real. This is showing the double ended sword of child to parent learning so that is why it is important for of the youth to get educated so the elder can not persuade our information.

<br><Br>

 From this video I was shocked by the amount of CO2 that was put in the air in just the last 60 years. I wish all youth would help take control of the planet. I agree that violence is not the answer but through protests, changing lifestyles, and voting the right people into office I believe that we can make a difference.
<br><hr>
your response to Ken was especially engaging and interesting to me because I have always been interested in going vegetarian. While I don’t think I could make the immediate jump to becoming a vegan, I aspire to work my way towards eliminating meat from my diet. The point on parent intergenerational education and connection is comforting because I don’t know how my parents would react if I told them that I wanted to become a vegetarian. My expectation has always been that they would judge me and tell me that I must have meat in my diet in order to stay “healthy.” Your experience with your parent is inspiring because it is evident that this strategy to deal with the climate crisis works. In addition, it also helps to teach the older generation the importance of caring about the crisis and acting upon it accordingly. I agree that love plays a big role in the parent intergenerational education strategy because family members love one another to the point where they are willing to learn and accept one another. If my siblings came up to me to teach me about something that I was doing wrong, I would not take their lecturing with a grain of salt but actively try to understand and make choices to support the views of my siblings. 

<br><Br>

Another very important point that I personally believe is just as crucial is voting and political participation. Ken brings up a really good point as to why the older generation is not acting. These people are in power in congress and corporations which means that they have the power to decide whether or not the climate crisis should be addressed. These people are much older and have not felt the effects of the climate crisis in their lifetime because of the time delay. Therefore, the climate crisis is not an issue that is apparent to them when it is compared to social security, immigrants, terrorism, and health care. Voters who are 65+ are also more engaged in politics when compared to the youngest generation of voters. This leads to representatives being elected who prioritize healthcare and social security, policies that will affect the older generations sooner than the climate crisis will in their lifetimes. Therefore, I agree with Ken that our generation must take action now. If we wait until everyone in congress to pass away, I believe that it will be too late.

I had a similar experience with my parents after they accompanied me during freshman orientation and move-in here at UCSB. I am from the East Coast, and while environmental awareness is not the worst in the country, it is definitely behind California. I have been a vegetarian/vegan throughout high school, and my diet was always an issue for my parents when it came to grocery shopping and family dinners. I took it upon myself to cook vegan meals for my family to show them that veganism is more than carrots and lettuce for each meal. Once my parents saw how environmentally conscious California is with plastic bag fees at grocery stores, popular use of reusable water bottles and refill stations, compost and recycling bins much more present in public areas, much more vegetarian and vegan options at restaurants, and use of public transportation or environmentally conscious transportation like bikes, they finally understood the importance of living more sustainably. I noticed this when I went home for winter break especially. My mom stopped buying plastic water bottles, and got a reusable one for my brother and my dad. She cooked many more plant-based dishes than usual, and built up an arsenal of reusable grocery bags. I have always advocated for being more sustainable to my family, but I think the shock value of how behind the East Coast is in comparison to California had the biggest impact on my family. My parents have also influenced me from a young age to be politically active, and as I have grown older I have realized how important this is in helping reverse the effects of the climate crisis. I am excited to be voting in my very first presidential election this year, and I hope to advocate to my peers to do the same in order to bring on the changes we so desperately need.
<br><hr>
I 100% agree that child to parent intergenerational education and connection about climate crisis issues is extremely important. My family is strictly conservative and laugh at the thought of global warming and climate change. Being able to show them material that they, indeed, pay for me to learn has been very eye opening and idea changing for them. They had no idea the effects that climate change will cause and has already been enacting in the past few years. Being a native of California, the fires are indeed extremely scary and threatening and my family now understands that these things are happening due to the rapid rise in climate rather than freak accidents. 
<br><Br>

Also coming from a family who has never been to college and taken prestigious courses like English 23, my family appreciates what we have been learning greatly. Not everyone gets to experience this knowledge and it is our job to teach as many people as possible.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you! It seems like throughout my whole life my parents incorporated meat into one of our meals and to be honest I never loved it. But last quarter after taking English 22 I chose to become a vegetarian, and after constant conversations with my parents I managed to convince them to only meat once or twice a week. Even my brother has decided to become a vegetarian. My dad was skeptical much like you said your parents were at first mainly because he grew up with parents who owned a deli. However, he actually has been one of the more supportive people about it. Whenever I go home he'll make sure our meals are healthy and if they have meat, he'll have something else for me. 
 <br><Br>
  It's definitely interesting hearing my parents perspective about climate change because they too are in ken's generation and they have said to me that they don't believe climate change is as closely related to human action as people have led on. But I have spent a considerable amount of time discussing issues of climate change, especially because I am an environmental studies major after all. I enjoy telling them ways that they can cut back on their fossil fuel consumption and how to be more environmentally friendly. For example they used to buy plastic water bottles every week at the grocery store, but now they both have reusable water bottles. 
 <br><Br>
  I'm pretty sure they have changed their ways because they can see I am passionate about this and they want to be supportive.
<br><hr>
I also agree with you about how one of the most effective ways of change is through the intergenerational learning. I’ve been concerned about the environment for a long time and my parents have known this. For elementary school I went to a science magnet school that was all about the environment and how to protect it; we had an “outdoor” classroom which had every California ecosystem. So from a young age I would come home and discuss with my parents about how we need to be more eco friendly. Recently, I enrolled in this class and I’m learning in depth about the climate crisis. Every couple days I phone home or send a quick text about the updates. I told them how I’m changing my diet, told them to read the “Uninhabitable Earth”, and other quick facts. This affected my parent’s decisions because now they too are making changes with their lifestyles. They no longer eat beef and try to eat less meat. This is proof that intergenerational learning works. Yes, I’m anxious about the climate crisis but after watching this lecture I have some hope about the future because I see how we can create meaningful change.
<br><hr>
Like the Beatles said, “ all you need is love” (kisses to Paul and John). They had it on point, one of the only ways to truly spread the message is by incorporating it with sincerity. I have also convinced my parents to be more aware of their waste because I mentioned how they might not get grandchildren. Now if we could convince the politicians in charge that when this next mass extinction hits, money will not follow them to the afterlife. Like Ken always says, we need to vote for change, we need to vote for the people that can spread love throughout the United States.
<br><hr>

In response to your comment, I commend your parents for listening to you about going vegan and how it could help to alleviate the climate crisis. I also agree that familial love is strong, and that the intergenerational education and connection could go a long way in preventing the growth of global warming. Throughout our childhoods, we grew a relationship with our parents like no other such as when our parents know when we are hurting or sad. I believe people should learn to have this relationship with planet Earth. We should know when our planet is hurting due to the actions of our species and try to do everything in our power to alleviate the pain that the Earth is currently feeling. We need to express this to climate deniers to show them that Earth is also a living, breathing species of its own and how we need to fix our ways before the Earth faces inevitable destruction due to poor decisions made on behalf of the human race.
<br><hr>
As much as I love the concept of intergenerational education, I have to admit that I have tried so hard to win my parents over to being more environmentally conscious. However, it has not worked at all. In my situation, both my parents subscribe to the notion that climate change is a hoax and a political movement against the driving forces of our economy. When I try to advocate for sustainability, I am met with resistance and the declaration that I know nothing because I am "an idealist in college". Instead of opening up a discussion, my parents tell me with certainty that my views will change when I get to the real world. 

 <br><Br>

I have to disagree that familial love will convince our family members to change their ways. I know my parents love me dearly, but unfortunately, that is not enough to shift their paradigm. I am sure I am not the only one in a situation where advocating for climate change falls on deaf ears. On the bright side, if I can't convince my parents, I can convince my friends and as Ken mentioned, we can encourage each other to vote. Ken's point about political clout in the older generations because of voter turnout can be upended if we turn out to vote.

I agree that the impact of the child to parent intergenerational education and connection is quite large and powerful. I have talked to my parents about the climate crisis and they have taken some actions to lessen the waste that they generate. My mom has become opposed to getting take out, insisting that if we are to eat out we should eat at the restaurant. This reduces the amount of plastic that is used and then thrown away. If the circumstances force us to use the plastic to-go containers, my family makes an effort to clean the containers and put them in the recycling rather than the garbage can. My dad, after learning more about the climate crisis, made sure to read up on all of the ways to dispose of waste, what object goes where and where things can't be disposed. He is always double-checking to make sure that things that don't have to be in the trash don't end up there. My dad also is a big supporter of donations and would rather have us donate old clothes rather than toss them.
 <br><Br>


Both of my parents understand that even after they're gone, the earth will still be here to be the living space of their descendants. Their love for those they don't even know yet is amazing. I am so lucky to have parents that understand the future and will act to make it better.
<br><hr>


I really appreciate your comment, and I agree that child to parent intergenerational is the most effective way to communicate climate crisis issues. I had an experience similar to yours, during college I have transitioned to a heavily plant based diet. This was a shock for my family, because I have never shown any interest in vegetarianism or veganism my entire life. Initially, they were very supportive and said that they were happy I wanted to make changes for my health and for the environment. However, they said that they could never do it themselves, because they just liked eating meat so much. When I came home this winter break though, I was surprised to find that my parents had decided they wanted to incorporate more vegan and vegetarian meals into their weekly diet. They told me they had made this decision because they watched a documentary that deeply affected them, and they knew that they could have the resolve to do it because I had already set an example for them. I know that not every parent is as open-minded and willing to change their ways, but I think that leading by example is one of the most impactful things our generation can do.
<br><hr>

I really liked how you addressed the idea of intergenerational education and connection that Ken mentioned in the video. I agree with a number of the things you mentioned about it, and I find your story about going vegan and convincing your parents that it was the right thing to do quite inspiring. I think there are a lot of things we can learn from our parents and similarly, there are a lot of things they can learn from us. Recently, ever since taking English 22 last quarter, I have been trying to cut down on my meat intake, and trying to eat less beef and more chicken or pork. As someone who never even considered going vegan before, I find it a bit drastic for me to jump from eating quite a lot of meat, to someone who eats no meat at all, so I have been trying to take baby steps towards changing my diet. I have also talked to my mom about the consequences flying and driving is doing to our planet, and she is now leaning towards purchasing an electric car to use in hopes of lessening our carbon footprint. She has also been considering putting up solar panels, which I think is a very good idea. 
  <br><Br>
I also really love your reasoning on why our parents are willing to listen to us, and I completely agree. The reason why parents are willing to change their ideas and why intergenerational education is so effective is because they love us. I think sometimes, our parents (and honestly everyone) are so busy with their daily life that they forget about the big picture things that are threatening us. In this case, climate change is something that is quite invisible, and its consequences are not seen in our day to day life. However, if we as children are able to remind them that this issue has an impact on our futures, I think they will be willing to change to help this cause. As Ken mentioned in the video, one of the biggest things we can do is to vote. As someone who has never been too politically involved, I have never really thought of voting, and neither has my mom. However, now I am considering keeping tabs on politicians and voting so that I can help with the climate crisis.
<br><hr>

Your response to Hiltner’s video seems to be very popular with all the comments and likes, as it should! Even though I have taken global warming with David Lea and decided to enroll in this course, I have never taken such action like you. I have only done little things like recycle, use a reusable cup, or decrease my beef intake. Even after watching Hiltner talk about child to parent intergenerational education/connection, I didn’t really think of how much of an impact it would be talking to my parents until reading your comment. Now thinking about it more, I am not even sure if they are aware of climate change. When I go back home to visit, I will definitely bring it up! Now that I am more aware of more small actions I can take, I will register to vote and follow through with my belief of ending climate change. Similar to me, I believe that is why people are not taking action because they are unaware of the small things they can do, and only aware of the bigger things which is a lot more work/dedication. Thank you for sharing your experience!
<br><hr>

I wanted to respond back on this post for a few reasons. One reason is that I also am vegan and have been for the past 4 years. I was met with skepticism from family as well. However, after years of discussing issues surrounding fossil fuels and animal agriculture I have changed my parent’s perspective on things and have even gotten them to incorporate more sustainable products and vegan options. With that said it is still not enough to fundamentally change our culture. After watching the lectures posted by Ken I realized that I still could do more to talk to family members about the importance of this issue on a more personal level. I use to go about this topic by talking about what it could do for the planet and the animals that inhabit it. However, I think now I need to go for a more personal explanation as to why this stuff matters. Like Ken pointed out this is our future and our children’s future. I admire this post for pointing out that it is love that works. I agree that it is the love between families that will bring on big changes. We cannot do this alone and will need the support of our parents to make the change we wish to see in the world. 
  <br><Br>
Overall, I appreciated this lecture for pointing out that our consumption and our generation’s resistance to voting that is contributing to the climate crisis. Those are two things that our generation can be actively working on right now to take control.
<br><hr>
In the words of Ken himself: We do not have decades, we do not have years to act. We must act now. The reality is we have been handed a planet that has been mistreated and tortured for decades. We may not want the responsibility of fixing the damage that has been done but we don’t have a choice but to take action. My parents have always told me that things will only get done the way you want them to be if you do it yourself. I believe this should be our generation's outlook on the climate crisis. 
  <br><Br>

We are the first generation to experience, believe, and try to change the planet. We are more powerful than we know! This is why I enjoyed your comment so much, you made a personal change and now your parents, an earlier generation, are looking up to you for help to create change. I love this fact and I believe it can be applied to our generation as a whole,  all we will do in the future to help the planet, and how we will hopefully get older generations to look to us for guidance. This is how we are different. We want change and we will do it because for the climate change to be handled the right way, we must do it ourselves.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, in that the intergenerational conversation about climate change is significant in terms of gearing ourselves into a sustainable lifestyle. I think on so many issues and controversial topics, the most important thing one can do is communicate, but also listen. By giving someone with an opposing view or different perspective the chance to talk, you can learn about the root of an issue and build a stronger understanding of other's beliefs. 
  <br><Br>

Like you, I too have spoken to my parents about climate change. I have made sustainable changes in my life and urge my parents to do the same. Though I am lucky because my parents are very open and respect that I am trying to teach them to lead a more sustainable life. I think everyone, whether it be between friends, family, or strangers, it's important to bring the climate crisis into our daily conversations. Some habits are easier than others to change, but if everyone struggles together to change their diet, use reusables, and cut down on consumer culture, we can take the first steps towards a sustainable lifestyle.

<br><hr>
Similar to you, I have a strong feeling about the intergenerational education because it is reflective in my personal experience and my family as well. In fact, this strategy works not only in topics about climate crisis, it is also effective in any other subject that does not require too much expertise. In communicating with my parents, not only can they get to know the cause-effect relationship underlying the superficial problems, I may also think more in depth about the reasoning and get a comprehensive understanding of the overall consequences. Particularly, when I communicated the idea of minimalism (thanks to ENGL 22) with my parents, they got the chance to reflect on their consuming habits and figure out what portion of stuff they bought was unnecessary. In the mean time, I was able to re-think about what is good about minimalism and how people can get benefited from it as well as how the climate crisis can be mitigated though the practice of minimalism. After communication, I found myself having a better understanding of the reasoning behind and the most essential concepts. This is essentially a win-win process in the sense that  new ideas are introduced to the older generation while I can go over things that I have learned.
<br><hr>
I also enjoy your personal story and I also think this story is inspiring as it shows me a good example of how we can make a difference about climate change in our life. I also really like your way of making a difference, which is peaceful, heart-touching, and warm. Compared to protesting or demonstrations, I personally prefer this way of change as I think person-to-person communications, especially those between intimates, is really effective and is easier due to the trust between people. 
   <br><Br>

Ken's lecture mainly explains three ways to act to help with our climate change, including voting, youth movements, and intergenerational education. I believe all three ways are effective, and I also think for people with different characteristics, different ways can be effective to different extent, or that some people prefer one way and other prefer another way. However, I think one important step to take is also to start an action by ourselves first. For example, if I want to communicate with people and convince them to reduce the use of disposable paper coffee cup, I would start from myself, so that people around me can see my honesty and are more likely to follow. 
   <br><Br>

I also think besides the short-term actions we can take such as protests and communications, we can also set ourselves with long-term goals, or in other words, align our short-term goals into our long-term objectives. For instance, I am currently double majoring in Environmental Studies and Pre-Economics, because I want to investigate effective ways to find and achieve the balance between environmental preservation and economic development, or more generally, the harmony between human and the nature. I hope that one way when I am empowered with more professional knowledge and tools, I can make a difference in a more significant circumstance or with a bigger impact. Therefore, my academic pursuit is a long-term goal I am pursuing, and along the journey of pursuing it, I will also try my best to do little by little, start from my life, to become environmental-friendly and live a sustainable life.
<br><hr>
The part where Ken talked about the child to parent intergenerational education and connection was also the part that stuck out to me the most. I wish that I had as a successful story as you did with talking to my family about the climate crisis. I would always get frustrated at my parents for having such wasteful tendencies but they do not care about how their actions affects the environment and still continues their bad habits. Props to you for choosing to become a vegan after taking english 22! That is true that familial love can help change people’s perspectives on things.  I hope that my parents can soon be like your parents and incorporate a different lifestyle way of doing things once in a while.
<br><hr>
This form of communication also struck me. My sister went vegan a couple of years ago because she found out how much our diets affect climate change. My parents went vegan after to support her and I went vegetarian to do the same. I recently joined in being completely vegan after looking into the environmental impacts myself. This just goes to show how much my parents and I learned from my sister. It’s strange because I always think about how much my parents have taught me, but I never think about how much I have taught them. I never felt like it was my responsibility to teach them because they are obviously older than me and thus carrying more life knowledge than me, but it really is my responsibility to teach them. It should be everyones responsibility to teach everyone.
<br><hr>
Like you, I took ENGL 22 last quarter, and to hear you make such a big change in your life by going vegan, I applaud you for that! Changing eating habits is definitely not easy for many people when it makes up such a big part of our culture and life, but as we learned in ENGL 22 and the films we watched (such as “Cowspiracy”), our food choices make a huge difference and many times, contribute greatly to the climate crisis we face today. I similarly felt like the activist strategy of child to parent intergenerational learning seems like the strongest way to go (rather than violence). A direct, personal approach often hits the heart the most, as to do this, you really have to put a picture in their head to make them understand what you are fearful of, going through, and advocating for. There’s a level of guilt in this strategy as well as love, like you said.
   <br><Br>


The problem of denial and fear of being wrong is a very common thing, which as professor Hiltner stated in his other video, is why his generation hesitated to act. In communication theory class, we learned about the Cognitive Dissonance Theory, which is where when people find themselves having thoughts that are inconsistent with anything, we experience discomfort, and we alleviate this discomfort by eliminating the inconsistency and try to justify our behavior somehow. Such examples would be like those that believe the earth is flat, and despite all the evidence pointing one way, they will try to justify their stance in any way possible, some out of true belief, some out of fear of being wrong, and those that have gone too far and don’t want to turn back just to be wrong. This seems to mirror what older generations are facing along with many other factors, as they face the dilemma of denial.
   <br><Br>


Other than love that you mentioned being a core part of this whole process, professor Hiltner’s other suggestion is also a key one, and in the very recent years, has been pushed more than ever, especially on our school campus just from students handing out flyers and spreading the word to get as many of us registered for voting as possible. Our voice counts, in any vote, and that is the beauty of our democracy which we should ultimately be taking full advantage of for the betterment of our world, and ourselves. Even before professor Hiltner gave the statistics about how in the 2018 US midterm elections, how voting turnout was higher than ever (especially within and around our age range), I felt it myself, from my friends around me actively talking about it. Unfortunately, it’s true that the generation ahead of us still holds control in many power positions, which makes it difficult for us, but our youth movements are not amounted to nothing. Every vote counts, so I hope that our voting turnout to speak our voices grows higher. This will definitely help change the game!
<br><hr>
I think it's interesting that you bring up your parents' willingness to adapt to diet that incorporates more vegan meals when they were already vegetarian; that's not at all to say that's not constructive - it very much is - however it does lead me to question whether they had previous ideas about the climate crisis that were acting on. Most people who eat vegetarian tend to say it’s either for the environmental impact or because they simply don’t want to eat animals, and, assuming it’s the former, that would imply prior knowledge of anthropogenic reasoning behind the climate crisis. 
   <br><Br>

I was vegetarian for a good portion of high school, and though I tried to explain the environmental and moral reasons to my parents in this same sense nothing about their behavior changed. My parents aren’t climate deniers per se, but they do share much of the generational thought processes and discourse surrounding our impact on the earth. 
   <br><Br>

All this is not to suggest that parent intergenerational communication and education cannot make an impact, but I’m simply posing that such ideas are much more easily communicated to folks who already have some semblance of the issue. As far as reaching the people who don’t necessarily want to listen, or when they do don’t internalize it, there is incentive in showing the impacts close to home that will undeniably occur.

<br><hr>
Child to parent intergenerational education is most certainly important for our future. I'm glad that it was helped open your parents' eyes on the climate crisis. Unfortunately, this won't work for everyone's parents because of the way they grew up and were raised. For example, my parents try and limit their waste and acknowledge the climate crisis, yet, as the video stated, it is still an issue of lesser importance. I'm sure that other peoples' parents are even less accepting of the climate crisis. However, I still believe that everybody should still try because the more that the severity of the climate crisis is showed to the older generations, the more that their vote could reflect our vote.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement that the love found in family is the strongest bond an individual can experience. As a result, it seems as an effective connection that we can all use in order to mitigate the climate change crisis as Ken talked about in this video. I had a similar experience in high school when I took an environmental science class and came back home with all this new knowledge that I was eager to share with my family. Most of what I learned from the class was new information and made me realize the consequences of simple actions, such as consuming meat or fast fashion, on a larger scale. I never really fully considered the detrimental effects of consumer culture because I always viewed it as if one person decides to go vegan while many others don't what's the point? However, I realized that it is the power in the minority that take the initiative to create a better world for the planet. And if these numbers grow, the impact grows as well. Thus, resulting in a movement that brings about progress and change for the better for the sake of future generations to come. When I would tell my family about these types of topics they were shocked to hear how much destruction the planet is enduring the rate at which consumption is relentlessly growing. As a result, they became more environmentally conscious of food choices and even recycling. I feel that the reliability of these types of experiences with family demonstrate its effectiveness. We only want the best for each other and family will always be there to support one another, so anything to ensure the better livelihoods of one another is a change that is more easily received by the listening ear.

I think that child to parent intergenerational education is a very important first step towards combating the climate crisis. I have also had a lot of luck in telling my family about the climate crisis. Just by talking to my family I have convinced them to lower their meat intake by having meatless Mondays. I have also convinced them to start buying organic fruits and vegetables rather than ones covered in pesticides. I have also introduced my family to almond milk and vegan ice cream and they really like it. My family has also cut down our plastic bag intake and we are working on lower water usage. 
   <br><Br>
I also agree with Ken that our generation needs to take over. The past generations are choosing to ignore the crisis because it won't really affect them. Almost everyone in my generation believes in climate change and wants to find a way to put an end to it. It also isn't fair that the animals, who have no say in our actions, are going to be severely impacted and many of them already are. We are killing off the animals of this planet for our own selfish reasons.
<br><hr>
I was also really taken aback by Ken’s suggestion for the youth to educate their parents on this matter. My reaction to this fact is not a result of disagreement, but rather, I have found that adults do not often credit the youth as a reliable source of knowledge on current issues, let alone the superior source of knowledge. In my life, I have experienced many circumstances of adults assuming that I, as a young person, am not a reliable source of intellect. In one instance, I attended a talk by Robin DiAngelo on her book White Fragility, a book that addresses the negative impact that white progressives have on black people’s fight against oppression. Before DiAngelo began her talk, an older woman next to me leaned over and asked me if I had read the book. I told her I had. She then inquired, “Was it assigned for a class?” I told her no. She then said, “Oh. Good for you.” Throughout the talk, we were asked to engage in discussion with our neighbors, and the woman was continuously visually shocked that I contributed. In moments like these, I find myself getting frustrated with the older generations for their lack of faith in the intellect of people my age. For this fact, I appreciate my generation being granted credit in this regard. Our generation has taken the steps to educate ourselves on the climate crisis in a way that past generations have failed to and it is now our responsibility to educate those generations for the sake of our disastrous present and grim future.

You're very lucky to have parents that are so supportive of your decisions and interested in climate change. I decided to go vegetarian for environmental purposes and my parents were skeptical and not very supportive. They didn't understand why I was doing it even though I tried to explain. It's strange to me that even though my parents are really good people and supportive in so many ways, why they weren't supportive of my vegetarianism. It also confuses me why they don't seem more worried about the state of our planet and what the future holds. 
   <br><Br>

Perhaps it is the generational issue as Ken said. It seems as though my parents are very set in their ways and don't want to change their diet. Also, my parents grew up not thinking about the environment or worrying about it. Back then they simply didn't the consequences of their actions. It doesn't mean they can't change their ways now though. 
   <br><Br>

I get very concerned knowing what I know about the state of our earth and being unable to spread that knowledge to others. Especially the older generation. My extended family is so stubborn and ignorant about the issue of climate change to the point that it seems like they simply do not care.
   <br><Br>

I think that one of our biggest issues is spreading the knowledge we know to others so that they know the consequences of their actions and therefore can make more educated decisions. It is not enough to just know that climate change is real and is happening and progressing every day.
<br><hr>
While watching the lecture videos this was also a point that stood out to me. I thought about how I have effected my parents and their beliefs. My parents both have a middle school education and were not taught about their effects on the climate. Fortunately, my siblings and I were taught about this issue. I was very into helping the environment, especially when California was having a drought. I cut my showers down to 5 minutes. At first I was made fun of for it from my mom especially. "How can you take a good shower in 5 minutes" but as I explained to my mom the severity of the drought I saw her taking approaches to lower her water use. By taking shorter showers, minimizing water use when washing the dishes, and changing the shower head to a water saving one. So, we do indeed have an effect on our parents. 

   <br><Br>

I also thought about how this might work the opposite way. My fear is that those that are deniers have passed that belief onto their children, and  that belief may be passed down generations. My hope is that those that are believers will out number the deniers and change will come.

<br><hr>
I’m doing whatever to lower my carbon footprint and I’ve been trying to get my parents to do the same. My parents can’t vote so I can’t convince them to make changes in that way but I have managed to cut back on meat. This was particular difficult as meat is a staple part of my parents daily meals and culturally significant. However, myself and probably more importantly, their doctor managed to convince them. It is a lot work and sometimes I wonder how much of a difference I’m actually making. But I guess doing nothing would be contributing to the problem and I don’t want to be part of that history.
<br><hr>
The child to parents intergenerational education and connection strategy was the main takeaway that I got from this video as well. Growing up I lived in a house with my mom who was very environmentally conscious. I feel lucky that she raised me to have an understanding of this climate crisis and how to be conscious. Although none of my siblings or I are vegan, we have been participating in meatless Mondays since I can remember. When I look at what I eat today, I probably only have meat once a week or so and stick to a primarily vegetarian diet. After watching these videos and hearing Ken talk about how his generation in general has failed ours, I feel very lucky to have been raised by a parent who was so conscious. This has helped me make cleaner choices when it came to moving out and living on my own. I don't eat a lot of meat, I try to avoid buying things in plastic containers, I try to shorten my showers and turn lights off when I leave, I even bought a Prius to try and reduce my footprint. Although I can see now that these changes are extremely small compared to the change this world needs I think it is still important to try and do your individual part. Just from being in this class alone I have shared this information with so many members in my family so they can learn what I am learning as well. I am enrolled in this class, Climate Fiction, and Consumption. It is heavy to learn about these things pretty much 5 days a week but it is important and adds information to these crucial conversations we need to be having with those who need to hear it.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in that the child to parent intergenerational education is a viable activist strategy. In my own household, both of my parents are "Boomers" largely unaware and ignorant of the effects of climate change and what their generation has done to contribute to the crisis. They argue that climate change has no real effects and will continue to do so for a long time, rather focusing on other issues like Social Security and health care. Because of the time delay in the effects of climate change, they don't understand just how pressing the issue is and that it will directly affect them in their lifetime, while they can clearly see that issues like Social Security and health care threaten their livelihoods in the near future.

   <br><Br>

In communicating with my parents about the real-time consequences and how that will affect me and our future generations they have opened up to the idea that climate change has reached the point where it is a crisis, however, the issue lies in encouraging a change in their lifestyle. It's almost scary that our society has encouraged such high consumption that we almost can't live without it, let alone make changes to decrease harmful consumption habits. This is one of the most concerning parts of changing our lifestyles to mitigate climate change because honestly, I don't completely believe we can make such a change, at least not completely. People may come to understand that such a way of living is extremely harmful to the planet, however, I doubt that the majority will make efforts to change their habits and consumption in a way that will make a very notable difference. If not on their own, I hope for some future government incentive to decrease consumption on a country-wide level, so maybe we have a chance to make a difference.
<br><hr>
Reading about your experience was very insightful. I, too, agree that having conversations about the dangers of climate change with our elders is very important. When I was being raised, my parents always made sure I was conscious about the impact I had on our planet and they would always encourage me to do the small things, like not wasting water, or turning off lights that aren't being used - you know, the basics. However, as the threat of climate change becomes more imminent, my elders have not taken bigger steps. Many times, I have noticed that my parents are not ignorant about the issue - they definitely care about our planet - but they just don't understand the severity of the threat that faces us. My sisters and I always comment on reducing plastic use, eating less red meat, and carpooling more often. At first they are usually reluctant about our suggestions but they always give in, and like you mentioned, it is out of their love for us. One last thing I am still trying to get them to do is to vote, which is something Ken emphasized in his lecture as well. My sister and I both voted in 2018, but my parents aren't too willing to, simply because they don't trust the politicians. Hopefully I can convince them to register in 2020 and get then familiar with the candidates so that we can get some world-changing leaders in Congress and the White House by next year.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that family members have the most influence over each other compared to any other person. I have some seemingly insignificant, but noteworthy examples from my own family. A few years ago, my mom was someone who left the lights on when she left the room, never recycled, and wasted a lot of food/disposable items. I would tell her to please start changing her habits, because it meant a lot to me. Now, she is becoming more and more invested in the climate crisis, and I often see her checking that our recyclable items are clean and dry. Similarly, my dad is now obsessed with installing solar-powered lights in our backyard and looking into panels for the house. Yes, these are small things that seem so unimportant considering the vastness of the global climate, but this proves that people CAN influence each other and I am ready to take the next step to influence my community. 
   <br><Br>
So, I hope that people in my generation start with changing the perspectives of their families, and then we can come together and influence our local community, our city, our state, our country, and then the world.

<br><hr>
I really like the idea of child to parent intergenerational learning. I think I've come a long way with my family and I'm glad that are a lot more understanding of the situation we are currently in. Before coming to college I remember always telling my mom about how everyone is going to die in 50 years and I probably won't even be able to have kids. I guess that's pretty dramatic but her response was always that the issue was out of control and I shouldn't waste my time thinking about it if I couldn't fix it. Then I came to college and my first quarter I had soc 1 and es 1 which both touched on the climate crisis. I learned a lot from both these classes and relayed a lot of the information to my parents. One of the days in soc we talked about the crazy amount of water bottles that people use. I immediately texted my parents telling them the overwhelming stats I learned, asking them if they could spot buying water bottles. I did the same thing again when I watched "The Meatrix" in soc, a video about the meat industry. I feel really lucky because my parents were very receptive of my suggestions. This type of communication doesn't just have to be between child and parent, it can be between siblings, aunts/uncles, and grandparents. All these people can still learn and change their ways for the better. I'm happy to help and relay my knowledge.
<br><hr>
After watching this video, I realize that most people who are in charge are from a generation who thrived on the use of fossil fuels, and are arguably still addicted to them. There are now many new ways of producing energy but the congressmen, senators, and president in charge stick with non-renewable ways of producing energy and polluting ways of extracting it. The Trump administration has even gone backwards regarding the climate crisis by reopening the coal industry and going back on the Paris climate agreement, among other things. I applaud and agree with Ken, our generation needs to act, by the time we will be elected and in power, some of the damages may already irreversible. Although this class has had an apocalyptic prediction of the future so far, the professor suggests ways that we can all act against climate change, and against the current laws in place to regulate the release of greenhouse gases. With the current administrations in place, a carbon tax and bans on certain industries, such as the coal industry, are unimaginable. However, they are no possible, some Northern European countries have already announced that they are producing 100% renewable energy to sustain their countries. If they can do it, America can too, but no with the current climate deniers currently in charge. As long as they are making the decisions for our future, the climate crisis will not be addressed sufficiently to reduce or even inhibit damaging the ecosystems of the planet any further.
<br><hr>
I agree, I strongly believe our generation has a responsibility to educate our parents and older generations on the urgency of the issue. About two years ago I decided to no longer consume beef and while my parents were initially confused even skeptical of my decision, they came to understand the reason I chose to make this change. While my mom was initially frustrated with the accommodations she had to make to cook dinner, she came to admire and support this decision. In 2 years alone I too have seen a major change in my parents understanding on the issue. I often send them documentaries I find impactful and continue to inform them on small changes they can make. 
   <br><Br>


Although I am in strong support of changes made on an individual level, it is equally important that changes are made on a the larger consumerists level. Changing unsustainable consumer habits is necessary and essential to mitigating this crisis. Too many people think making changes in their own life will make no difference but I truly believe individual change has the potential to make a massive domino effect. I find it so interesting the amount of people I have talked to about not eating beef who respond with “I’ve been considering doing that” or “I also don't eat red meat”. Every time I get these responses it makes me proud not only to hear about changes other people are making but also hope that the change I have made in my life inspires others to do the same.
<br><hr>
I loved reading about your personal experience! I think that it’s easier for all of us to make a change when we do it together. For me personally it was easier to stick to lifestyle changes by having a good support system surrounding me. I also took engl 22, last year, and that’s what kick started my awareness of the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
The activist strategy that struck me the most too was the child to parent intergenerational education. Since going to college, I also have changed my diet to much more vegan / plant-based, with my parents showing surprised reactions. Both of my parents have made it clear to me that they care about the environment, I believe that they do not really understand the scope of the climate crisis and what I am trying to do with my diet. After watching this, I will do a better job of talking to them about not only the benefits of this diet, but also talk to them about the concern of the future with the climate. Is this a world they feel comfortable leaving me and my future children (their grandchildren) in? How are they voting in elections? How high on their list of concern is climate change in voting? I know I will voice my concerns, and yes, with familial love, I know we can reach a common understand and deepen not only our knowledge of this crisis, but also our love with each other.
<br><hr>
I agree with your idea of familial love. Since we are family, mom, dad, grandparents are always supportive to us. It is our responsibility at this particular time period to tell them more about what we learned. The climate changes are delayed, so they might not be fully impacted by the detrimental crisis, even we might not, but our sons/daughters, and grandkids will. It is our opportunity to work together and eliminate those human activities that are environmentally friendly.
   <br><Br>

Ken's idea of voting is very correct. It is a significant way we can participate in this democratic society. We should "educate" our parents and grandparents about the climate crisis, and let the family to act together and vote. It is not my vote or your vote, it is our vote for our future.
<br><hr>
I completely relate to this post. I am a freshman now and switched to a vegan diet two weeks into my first quarter. I took a step back and looked at anything I could change that would help our planet so along with a vegan diet, I stopped buying from major companies, started supporting local shops, carpool as often as I can, and make sure to notify my family about the current crisis. All the films from this class I recommend to everyone I know and make sure to answer any questions they have to the best of my ability. My mom has gone vegan with me and my dad has slowly but surely started to ask more and more questions and is more than willing to listen to my rants or watch a video I send him. My grandparents are no longer deniers of climate change and the rest of my family are so interested in the latest things I am learning about. 
   <br><Br>
I agree that the love and connection we have with our families is what makes the difference. We relate on so many things and they understand where I'm coming from with my views, and I understand where they're coming from also. They want to support me so learning along with me is a part of that process. My grandparents tell their friends, my mom tells her coworkers, and my dad tells everyone why I'm studying environmental studies not only because they're proud, but because of me they now know what crisis we are in and how much worse it's going to get. Our relatives are lucky they have us to learn from and I think it's really special we get to teach them something too. 
   <br><Br>
Everything makes a difference and I think family is one of the best ways to start.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your story and seeing your ability to communicate your concern to your parents. Such conversations are very important for the future of our nation and our earth. The reason why is being able to bridge the generational gap on issues that affect everyone or just affect one generation and not another is an extremely effective way to demonstrate ideas and implement ideas with additional support. Vilifying one generation or labeling one generation as helpless victims of circumstance is just noise that inhibits a conversation that needs to be had between generations whether its about climate change or any other issue that we face.
<br><hr>
Interesting how we talk about influence between generations we often talk about the knowledge or habits passed down from former generations. What is easily negligible are the impact children have on their parents because of the love between the family members. 
   <br><Br>

Your story reminds me of the story of a mother fighting for the well-being of her daughter and her generation. Her name’s Chaijin, a journalist in China. Her daughter went through a major surgery because she was diagnosed with a tumor even before she was born. The mother felt incapable of changing the health condition of her daughter, so she tried to use her professional skills as a newsman to dig out the seriousness of the air pollution in China, and its negative impacts on the Chinese citizens. She made a documentary called “under the dome” to disclose the cruel facts and heartbreaking reality the next generation might suffer from.
   <br><Br>

Although the documentary was banned later by certain powers, it made a huge impact. Not only did it arouse the consciousness of the public, but it also influenced the legislation and indirectly caused the shut down of various factories.
   <br><Br>

Many can’t even imagine that the root cause of these huge changes in a country was a weak little infant.

<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly agree with Ken on how important it is to educate older generations on climate change. When I went transitioned from vegetarian to vegan last year, my parents were surprised because I "love cheese so much." They already know I have a big spot in my heart for animals, but when I started explaining the environmental consequences of eating dairy they understood. I am thankful that my parents have always walked beside me in my fight for environmental justice.

   <br><Br>

I do believe it is still important to educate others our own age as well. I have opened many of my friends' eyes at how beneficial going plant-based is. I can only hope they will pass on this information to their parents and their parent's parents as well. Once you bridge generational gaps, it is easier for that information to spread laterally too.
<br><hr>
I don’t mean to be pessimistic, but I feel as if this particular situation is uncommon and will not work most of the time. Although I like the idea of being able to share and educate my parents on the topic of climate crisis, I feel like most of the older generation cannot be swayed in their beliefs, and often, people older than us have too much pride to admit that they’re wrong (even if they have a sliver of doubt). As an example, my parents raised me telling me that global warming was fake and dumb, and their opinions have not changed with incoming facts about climate change. They laughed when global warming “changed into” climate change because they believed that none of these scholars knew what they were talking about. When I share facts with them, they discredit me and will not be swayed. In some families, this may work, especially in California, or Santa Barbara specifically, where people in general are more progressive and open to new ideas, but in places that are more conservative and have a large mass of people who are against climate change, it is much more difficult. 

   <br><Br>

I believe the most effective action can only be taken by our generation and we shouldn’t waste our time trying to get the older generation to undo what they have done, but start educating the younger kids about what their future looks like and what they could do to start now.
<br><hr>
Ken’s mention of this parent-to-child dynamic also made me think about the influences I’d like to think I’ve had on my parent’s outlook on climate change and their lifestyle choices in regards to the environment. I went vegan 4 years ago and I have also noticed that prior to my plant-based diet, our refrigerator was always stocked with a jug of milk and cuts of red meat. After my lifestyle change, there was rarely any dairy products and meats in our household. This has made me realize that although my parents weren’t very fond of my sudden change in diet at first, they eventually took up many of my meat and dairy substitutions and made it a habit to shop for more plant-based groceries. Like you, I was also able to watch my family grow into more conscious consumers and it has shown me that in order to make others aware of and take action in regards to climate change, we must appeal to what really matters to them in their time on Earth, and family is a major part of that.
<br><hr>
I felt the same way when Ken said this. Up until last quarter, I thought I was doing my part in the fight against climate change and learned that I could be doing more. I didn't eat or use a lot of animal products before, but a few weeks into fall quarter, I decided that I needed to officially go vegan. Both of my brothers are vegan, even if they are not doing it for sustainability reasons, so I just completed the trio. 
   <br><Br>
My parents believe in climate change, but the only sustainable action they do is recycle. They did not really understand why we went vegan or why I was so interested in living a sustainable lifestyle. I did not realize how well this strategy could work until I realized that I already used it to inform my family more about mental health and the LGBTQ+ community. Although, my parents seem less responsive to climate change than to any other topic I have brought up with them. Just the other day, I told my mom about how Ken apologized on behalf of his generation for causing the effects we are having currently and she did not understand why he would feel the need to, even after I explained the carbon emission numbers to her. My dad also does not like to hear about how consuming meat is bad for the environment since he eats a lot of it, so convincing him to cut back is proving to be difficult. 
   <br><Br>
Despite this, I believe that this is one of the best strategies we can take when it comes to getting older generations to help us combat climate change. I think that along with being protestors, voters, and activists, we can be messengers to the older generations, like recruiters.
<br><hr>
I too found this very interesting. It is true that older generations are mainly responsible for our rise in CO2 emissions and global warming but this does not have to be something that is set in stone. We can, as the younger generation, teach our elders to become environmentally friendly and leave their ways of the past. One way I have done this is with my parents as well. My parents use a lot of disposables: plastic cups, straws, etc. at home. After educating myself more about global warming and how each of us can do our part, I've convinced them to use more reusable items. For example, simple things like using a reusable water bottle rather than using plastic bottles, replacing straws with reusable straws, and to stop using plastic cups. Little things like this aren't going to make a big difference but if all of us are able to do our small little part with our child/parent connection, and educate older generations to change their ways, then our small efforts can truly result in some great change. I think this is a way we can all do our small part to help such as finding a more renewable, cleaner way for people we know in older generations to change. This may result in those polls rising in the amount of people from Ken and others' generations who increasingly care more about climate change and that small step right there could make a huge difference.
<br><hr>

I definitely agree that Intergenerational learning is one of the most effective ways to create collaborative action. My family has never really been politically involved so when I chose to major in political science they definitely questioned my choice, not only my immediate family but many extended family members as well. In fact over Christmas I had a conversation about it with my parents and a few aunts and uncles who are around Ken’s age. I explained to them the importance of me wanting to make a difference especially with climate change and how politics plays a vital role in making those differences. After explaining to them the various reasons why I believe climate change is of such great importance to me they responded by saying that they never thought about the long term affects and many of them believed that it was just nature taking its course; however after explaining to them all the ways we as humans are contributing to this irreversible damage they appeared much more interested and concerned. Since then my parents have been asking me a lot more questions about climate change, general politics and various social issues, my dad has even been talking about how excited he is to be able to vote for the first time this year.

<br><hr>

To respond to your comment, in western culture, I often notice the need to replace and have multiples of many things like electronics, clothes, shoes, and not to mention in America specifically, the gross waste of food in many establishments and households.  My parents taught me that to waste food is sinful for the fact that many people in this world do not even have access to a meal a day.  Through this course, I hope return the favor my parents did by educating me as young child by educating them on the impact of their daily decisions.  While I've made the small changes in my life to not participate in fast fashion and be politically active, many of my family members have not.  It's because I love them and want a safe earth for them that I want them to understand the threats we face through the climate crisis and what we can do about it, together.  To me, the child to parent intergenerational education and connection seems like the most effective strategy for raising awareness.

<br><hr>
I also found the child to parent intergenerational education activist strategy that Ken touched upon to be the most noteworthy. I think it is great that you were able to positively influence your parents with the actions you took in becoming a vegan. I also really like how you mentioned that this activist strategy works so well because of love. I do think it is true that people that love you will likely respond more positively and be more supportive of your thoughts and opinions. This is why spreading the issues of the climate crisis to our parents is a great way to reach that generation. 
   <br><Br>

I personally really enjoy having discussions on political topics and world issues with my parents, so I feel like this would be a great way for me to give them some more information on the climate crisis. This is definitely a discussion that I plan on having with my parents soon.
<br><hr>
Your response is interesting as I have a same experience with my parents too. However, instead of me parenting my parents with environment knowledge, my parents successfully transmitted their environmental-friendly points of view to me so I can make a change. I used to be a crazy tissue user because I never realized that paper comes from woods which should be protected instead of being cut down. My mom and dad were trying to tell me to use less tissue paper. Without a profound realization, I just don't think they were making any sense of my paper-using habit. However, later they watched a documentary on TV with me about the tissue industries huge impacts on the forests. It was so astonishing to see the bleak forests. I suddenly realized that my behaviors were part of the cause of the tragic scenario. My parents then pointed out my unhealthy living habits and I totally got them and I started to use tissue paper more environmental-friendly.
   <br><Br>
The materials of this course is great as they prevent us with necessary knowledge that we can influence others to make changes together. Personally I'm going to tell what I have learnt in this course so far to my parents and we will definitely make our lives more beneficial to the environment. Probably this is the power of parenting parents with knowledge. With the base of love and the common goal to help protecting the environment, I am optimistic that our generation will take up our responsibilities to address the issue in our own ways.
<br><hr>
I agree that the child to parent intergenerational education is very important in getting support from the older generation because it make them aware of more information on the topic. Parents are busy and do not have tine be looking up how the climate is doing so, I think having the younger generation explain things could influence the older generation when they go vote to think about their decision more.
<br><hr>
This last paragraph is very beautiful and so honest. In order to love our planet and protect it, we need to show love to each other. We need to support each so that we feel more collected as a group and have more of an urge to protect ourselves as a group versus by ourselves.
<br><hr>
The child to parents intergenerational education and connection also stuck out to me largely. Thinking about it, it is a hugely affective strategy if everyone communicates successfully with their parents to show why this is such a huge problem, and how it will affect future generations even if they will never see it. This stood out to me so much because I have been attempting to convince my parents that climate change is happening for years My dad refuses to believe it, but I have successfully convinced my mom that it is real and a problem. I know that by doing this, she will now vote for someone who wants to take a stand on climate change and make a difference. If everyone did this successfully, the polls would actually be swayed giving the government a chance to make a change and take action before it is too late.

Something that Ken said that hugely stood out to me was how we control 80% of the world's landmass. this just shows how capable we are of being so destructive of this amazing earth, and how we have affected the livelihood of so many other creatures who have zero control and no clue of why their kind are dying off so fast and why their habitats have been destroyed. Our culture of consumerism has spread, and is destroying the earth day by day. Instead of wanting more materialistic goods, which I am guilty of, why can't we just enjoy the earth and all the things it already gives us without abusing fossil fuels and other natural resources ?
<br><hr>
My attention was also drawn to the idea of child to parent intergenerational education and connection, but I think rather unfortunately in a different way then yours. I respect Ken's idea, this comment, and this person's situation quite a bit, but I feel that it simply isn't realistic for many families. For instance in my family, it is an unspoken hard line that dare not be crossed to say that my parents have something to learn from me- who is their undirectedly-stated inferior. In my family, I can try to gently persuade or ferociously argue with scientific facts something like this, but because of set-in-ways and the idea of age-superiority, will never gain any significant traction. Ultimately from this, I believe that if someone doesn't have an open mind or want to believe something, than they probably never will. Thus, I feel this situation is a bit more complicated than simply talking with my family.
   <br><Br>
The second thing that I found interesting was Ken's suggestion on how to partially fix this, being to bring power to our generation. I think it all sounds quite dandy and nice, but isn't the reality that we have been protesting for years now? And that at the end of the day, things really haven't changed? I would love to believe that if I attended a climate march or got a couple friends to, that everything could right itself, but is that really a realistic thought? Maybe it is, but I can't help but feel skeptical.

It seems problematic for everyone to hold themselves accountable for this healthier, tasteless diet, especially when you see others indulging in those sins and guilty pleasures. The Paris Agreement was suppose to also be a nonregulated agreement to hold each nation responsible for their actions, but many have not been following through. Social media seems to be used for lots of pointless time consumption. Turning this con into a postive by getting influencers and famous people to incentive the rest of the population to a new dietary trend seems like an efficient method. These role models can help us just as much as politicians.
   <br><Br>

The paradox of not eating one's ethnic food group because of climate harmful production. However, by being healthier and consuming more plants, you are upsetting one's culture. This irony is hurting those trying to be bold architects of the future. The film "Supersize Me" boldly highlights how unhealthy the American food chains are to people and to the environment. I don’t want to be like that or have others become like that. I am thankful vegan, organic, gmo free restaurants are becoming more popular. Hopefully the vegetarian style diet will only become more trendy.

I feel empowered that I am part of a generation that is actively combatting issues like the climate crisis. In the push for rallying and lobbying, I am seeing this message for more environmentally friendly solutions to be effectively and widely spread to the general public. Universities are centered where large political activity is being held. With students being a large population, there is great potential in swaying the agenda of local politicians and prompting movements that can be translated beyond campus. I think what is most important in the approach to tackling the crisis is for every individual to just simply do what they can. Like Ken mentions, there are some limitations based on your surroundings in adhering to practices that are sustainable for your daily routine. Even dedicating one day out of the week to eat plant based meals can make such a difference to your carbon footprint. Ultimately, we vote with our choices and our voices for what we believe in, and that is a privilege that the new generation should use wisely in this time of need for our planet.

<p>
Hearing the five suggestions to cut our climate footprint makes it sound so easy to make a difference. Having the knowledge necessary to make a difference should give us the responsibility to act upon it. In Ken’s other video he explains how his generation was aware that our fossil fuel and meat consumption would be ruinous, yet no action to stop the danger was taken. Instead, profit and wealth were prioritized, creating the world we know today. To me, the five suggestions aren’t radical ideas at all. Meat consumption does seem to be a bigger issue because people don’t like being told we have to change our lifelong eating habit. Consumerism is also a tough issue. It seems we measure success and wealth with how much things we can buy. The best example is the fast fashion industry: people buy clothes like it’s disposable, but no one truly needs an overflowing closet of clothes. It’s wasteful. I often see on social media videos of celebrities doing closet tours, and all I can think of is “how can one person NEED all of that?” While people argue “let people do what they want with their hard earned money,” I think it’s childish to ignore the harm and consequences selfish consumerism has on the planet.

Climate denial provides an easy way out for many of the older generations today who have caused the brunt of the climate change on Earth. They will not see much of the effects in the rest of their lives, but the younger generations who are already seeing its effects are not happy. It still frustrates me that generations of neglect have fallen on our shoulders. I don’t think that only our generation should be responsible for such extensive change. We cannot ignore the population of people in the older generations who don’t see this as an issue. We have to show them that it is a big deal. I think intergenerational learning could have a big impact on this because you are able to reach the older generations through a personal level. 
<br><br>
One issue I think comes with the idea of a youth led environmental movement is that I don’t think it will persist even if it does come to fruition. We have been raised into a world of fleeting media and constant distractions. The youth have so many distractions, especially from our consumerist culture, that they are drawn back in just as quickly as they are exposed to the truth of its issues. I am worried that we will not be able to fulfill such a loaded task, at least, not alone. I think for these reasons, environmental eduction is super important because we need EVERYONE to care.

<p>

The fact that Ken stated that the radical solution that he proposes is for our generation to take control of planet because we simply cannot wait until we are his age inspires me. I feel as if the climate crisis issue is something that I have become a lot more passionate about since attending this class and hearing all of the lectures surrounding this issue. It is completely true that the people who currently have the power are just doing more to exacerbate the situation instead of work to reverse its effects. The fact is that the power has to be transferred to the "generation that has a better grasp of the situation". By becoming more educated about these matters, our generation will in fact be able to make a difference. The knowledge about this issue is something that starts at home and in the classrooms. If we simply take more time to learn about this issue that will have a profound impact on us if we do nothing to stop it, we will be able to actually enact change. I am feeling extremely motivated after watching this video to make sure that change is enacted and a difference is made. The way in which we can change the planet that Ken proposed is to vote and that is completely true. I feel as if many of us choose not to vote because we think, "What difference would one vote make?". However, if we all have that mindset then of course we would be able to make a huge difference if we all vote. Especially, all of us in this class are all of voting age now and we should work to enact this change because the change starts with us.



</p><hr>


<p>

The truth of the matter is that Ken’s generation
was not looking out for the future of future generations even beyond my own.
But, it would be hypocritical to say that my generation is not also responsible
for having the same mentality. It is respectable of Ken to acknowledge the
fault of his generation and striving to move forward to address this climate
crisis. I thought it was quite energizing that Ken explained and championed
that as a society and as a nation we have to educate the consumer on the trends
that we adopt which harm the planet. For example, (the fashion industry) not
many people view it as such but it is a fact that it produces massive amounts
of Co2 emissions and other greenhouse gases. We need to stop been dependent on
disposable items as well and plastics that are not sustainable. I believe that we
should also stop using cars on the daily and move towards asserting cycling as
the dominant form of transportation as well as making our public transit more
adaptable and accessible

<p>

In this lecture, I can feel Ken’s urgency towards climate crisis. He repeats to tell us there is no time for us to wait for his generation, who has power now, to act. But, I am wondering how can we act without power. I don’t think vote can actually improve the situation because people who compose 2/3 vote are above 65-year-old. In other words, climate crisis won’t impact them a lot due to time delay, so it’s not a problem in their consideration. They care more about things like social security and healthcare. Besides, as Ken said we need to fundamentally reinvent Western culture of consumer culture in order to help moderate the climate crisis. However, we all know that it won’t be easy to redefine a culture as people are already used to it.



</p><hr>


<p>

After watching those two videos, I was surprised by how easily the older generation ignored climate change. That would be an unfair group, a whole generation because we know that people like Ken have actually tried to do something. Equally worrying is that our government is largely run by people over the age of 60. These people have a responsibility to make laws to help fight climate change, but they don't believe it's caused by human behavior. It's also frustrating that our generation is the one most concerned about the climate crisis, yet we don't have real government positions, and government officials refuse to make any real changes. Three-quarters of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been emitted by developed countries over the past 60 years. The older generation has been reluctant to accept the legitimacy of the crisis, seizing on unpopular claims and their denials. People seem to use any excuse to escape blame for the problems their actions may cause.



</p><hr>


<p>

The most important thing that Ken said in this video was "Vote and urge five friends to vote." In order to make any real changes, we need everyone to make changes in their lives, and there is no better way to do this than by having governmental regulations, such as a carbon tax that will inevitably be passed on to consumers. We will not be able to convince enough people to just eat only plant-based, but if there were regulations in place that made meat more expensive, many people would begin to do it. We also need to urge our friends to vote because otherwise we will not be able to outvote the older generations who rank climate change much lower on their priorities.



</p><hr>


<p>
People in the developed world are the ones who deny climate change the most because they have the privilege of being able to deny it. As professor Hiltner points out his generation is still in charge of much of the government. So, again it is up to our generation and future generations to help mend back earth to fight against the climate change. It is up to the developed world to do something to make positive changes.




</p><hr>


<p>

We already know that the slowing down the climate is urgent, but what should we do. We will be affected by climate change directly. One of the most effective means to protect environment is talking with our parents about the results of climate change (mentioned in the lecture). if we can deliver the consequences of climate change to our parents effectively, we can gain more support. Usually, the previous generation dd not matter climate change a lot, but we can explain the effects on ourselves and even their grand children. Also in my personal viewpoint, eat vegetables also contribute to the environmental movement. We must make responses to the climate change as quick as possible. We cannot wait for the climate change threatening our life.



</p><hr>


<p>
My favorite part of this talk is that Ken mentions that the reason human caused climate change has been able to flourish, is due to the low priority the generation that caused it assigns to it. I understand this sounds like a harrowing fact but it bodes well for our future. There is no significant progress stopping the gradual suffocation of our planet, but it is also maybe worth considering that there is seemingly no serious action taken. I suppose it’s slightly optimistic, but one could assume that the current and rising generation of powerful adults will be more frightened of this issue and feel inclined to act against it. 
<br><br>
You have to consider in your speech how you actually uncover a bit of this truth. Who is the we of ‘we consider combating climate change to be a low priority.’ I can say for certain I am not a part of the we who isn’t sobered and terrified by the disasters it leaves in its wake. I, for absolutely certain, am also not a part of the ‘we’ that is in a substantial position of power to participate in this battle. I would love to be - or at least by proxy. And I’m proud to note that a lot of my peers feel the same way, and also want to contribute to this conversation meaningfully. But lack that capacity now. Something can hopefully be done soon, but for the near future, change through that channel seems bleak. Those of the ‘we’ who do not feel threatened by the violent destruction of climate change, will eventually be removed from positions of power and hopefully my very scared generation can take over.  There is hope in ‘we’.
<br><br>

Finally, I feel encouraged by our generation because these are very embarrassing and vulnerable emotions to claim publicly. Things like fear being acknowledged and shortcomings being admitted to. In our prideful society, these can be difficult things to admit to. But they also happen to be a vital aspect the only thing that can properly move the conversation about climate change along. There is a harsh stigma against professionals one generation above us; self serving, tireless, heartless & often brutal. These generalizations contribute to an image that is exponentially less promising than that of the image and character of our generation. This is not about pride. We understand how trivial our individual emotions are compared to the fate of humanity on Earth as we know it. There is no time for cover ups, blame, lobbying, misinformation, guilt tripping, or dismissal. There is only time for silence and action. If the time can’t be now, then it will be soon.

The disparity between the older generations and the newer generations in regards to attitude towards the climate crisis is very frustrating. The older generation's attitude, like Ken said, is probably because they haven't suffered from the consequences for a large portion of their lifetime, and also most likely stems from the fact that they will not live long enough to see much more. Though this is a cynical take to the problem, I can't help but feel cynical in general because we are picking up after someone else's mess. I did like, however, that Ken mentioned that we should not direct our hatred towards every member of the older generations, because there are some out there who are doing just as much, if not more, than people in my generation in regards of environmental activism.

<br><br>

The proper response, like Ken states in the video, is to educate the generations that come after us, as well as our parents' generations. Though it is true that our generation will be in power very soon, as we all get older and become eligible to run for positions in political power, and even become old enough to vote,  there is the downside that as we have to wait, the planet continues to be destroyed. Our generation is simply watching a ticking time bomb tick away, as we wait for the planet to crumble.

I am sorry ken but your generation is honestly the reason the future of our mother earth will soon come to an end. I completely repect you for taking responsibility for what y'all have done and it I wonderful it is coming to an acknowledgment. However what I found very compelling is that you said we have to educate the consumer that what we WANT is not necessarily what we NEED. Coming together to explain that the little things do matter in regards to helping save the planet and emphasizing on what we can do to help save the Earth. Things like fast fashion, greenhouse gases, CO2 emissions, or even just simply recycling your plastic could all lead to a better and well sustained Earth living lifestyle. I have come to believe that many of many of these peoples carbon footprints are bigger than what they expect and two think from just switching from a car to a bike can make a significant impact on bettering the atmosphere. But we ALL have to come to a settlement because sooner or later we are all going to be effected. Soon , it will all be to late.

Both of this week's lectures highlight both the primary issue and great possible solutions... I just find it ironic how the solutions lie within our youth, yet our our lives revolve around the decisions of all the older "boomer" generation. You tell us to take control, yet we have little to no control of anything in society, let alone politics, corporal decisions, and environmental causes. We acknowledge the fact that we must take control, but it's quite difficult to take control when we are deemed to be not mature enough or inexperienced in every way. We know what we must do, and with the little control that we are able to grasp through rebellion we act as best as we can, but all the older generations continuously destroy our Earth, completely neglecting the state of our Earth. It's truly mind-boggling to believe that we acknowledge the dangers of our actions, yet we choose to continue our ways day to day, as if there aren't any problems. 
<br><br>
I do like and admire the idea of speaking out to our parents and our younger siblings, etc about the dangers of climate change and educating them on how our actions can affect the planet so gravely. I also believe we should each be making making personal changes in our lives, but I think we if we are truly endeavoring into the real grave environmental issues, then we must take care of all the major corporations that are poisoning our seas, killing off our planets animals, and destroying the vast ecosystems that indulge in our nature... But, the real difficulty of it all is time, we must act now, before it's too late.



</p><hr>


<p>

The first thing I have to say is how frustrated I am and how helpless I feel knowing that the older generation are the ones in power, yet they are doing nothing to help us, the younger generation, and instead do everything that helps them, even if it means they are leaving the world worse than how they found.  My dad used to always tell me, "always leave your campsite cleaner than how you found it", and I feel like this is applies very well to our current predicament.  As harsh as it sounds, the older generation isn't going to be here for much longer, so why are we letting them control our lives, when the consequences of their actions will have no effect on them, but will on us?  I think that the biggest reason the older generation is in denial is because the effects of pumping co2 into the atmosphere had a delayed effect, so they grew up in a world where they didn't have to worry about a climate crisis, and suffered no adverse effects from their actions.  I agree with Ken that power needs to shift from the older generation to the younger generation if we want to see change happen, and start to tackle climate change.  So much of carbon emissions are caused by large, corporate organizations who care for nothing except themselves and their pursuit of more wealth and power, which is a very sad and brutal truth.  It does, however, give me hope knowing that there are people in the older generation, like Ken, who have a voice and are trying to make themselves heard.



</p><hr>


<p>

I completely agree with Ken on the terms that our biggest way to make an impact on the climate crisis is to rise in political power. However, as optimistic he may be, that goal is quite far from reach. Reaching a political status at my age is rather unattainable without a career or any true political experience let alone any experience at all. Enacting changes through legislation would allow our generation to make wide-scale adjustments, but for now we can only wait while the older generations who prioritize climate change on the latter half to carry out their terms. 
<br><br>


However, teaching our parents about the effects of climate change seems like a great way to educate the older generations who aren’t as exposed to research and social media. Many conservatives in the population tend to be older and steadfast in their beliefs while many kids like me who attend a university are exposed to socially liberal issues. For people like my dad who is very conservative, they often only watch the conservative media outlets and completely ignore the other perspective. I will try my best to provide some insight and knowledge the next time I have a conversation with him.



</p><hr>


<p>

A radical solution is absolutely necessary and urgent. Thinking about this has been very daunting, after all our minds can make us think we are too little to make any real change, but I think our minds are also capable of helping us imagine a better future. Taking control of the earth, as Ken mentions is radical, but it is essential to the survival of humanity. I have been learning about the climate crisis and the climate justice movement for the past two years and it is so inspiring and emotional seeing how much impact the youth movement has made in just a couple of months. While there is still so much that needs to be done, the global climate movement is quickly gaining momentum and making our voices heard. As a scholar-activist myself, I have been making some lifestyle changes that will hopefully inspire others around me. For example, I have taken on the challenge of living a plastic free lifestyle, meaning, I am trying to reduce my consumption of plastic material, while simultaneously reducing the amount of unnecessary waste I produce. Additionally, I am building community around the climate crisis by being a part of Eco-Vista, a group of incredible people who are striving to make our small college town of Isla Vista a more sustainable and welcoming place for future generations. Taking over power and control of this planet is in our hands, and it takes as little as making lifestyle changes, voting (if you have the privilege to), or joining a like minded community of eco activists.



</p><hr>


<p>
I am really excited about the upcoming lessons in this course which deal which will teach us how we can live an environmentally friendly lifestyle because I believe that this is where the real issue of climate change is addressed. When I first read the Ken's website, I was particularly interested in the sections where he provides suggestion on how to live environmentally cautious. I think it is safe to say that among my generation, climate change is a trending topic that has a lot of positive popularity. But I am doubtful of the amount of people in my generation that actually task themselves with changing their habits and their day to day choices to fight against climate change. It's easier to say one thing than it is to practice it. After learning about how harmful the meat industry is for the climate, I decided to become vegetarian. It isn't easy. I am only a week in and I have newfound respect for people who have been vegetarian for years. And don't get me started with vegans. It is a serious test of willpower and determination, ESPECIALLY when a burger at McDonald's costs less than a salad anywhere. As of now, I can understand that certain choices are more convenient than others (healthy food v.s. fast food for example) that's why convincing someone to step out of their comfort zone for the greater good of our planet is going to be really hard. But by way of popular demand, if you switch to an environmentally friendly diet, then convince your friends and family, one by one, we can make companies market healthier options as the more convenient options.Well, hopefully I can learn more about how I can do my part against climate change in this course, beyond just changing what I eat.

<p>
Older generations don't prioritize climate change because they won't be the primary victims. Younger generations are taught to respect their presumingly wise elders, and young people often get shrugged off as unknowledgeable and inexperienced in life. It can be difficult to teach an old dog new tricks, as many people won't break their lifestyle habits. Self-interested people aiming to be rich instead of charitable and altruistic don't see the long term risks. Communication among generations is important as well as recognizing each others humanity. It is important to recognize our place in the course of history while recognizing the truth and possible outcomes that lay ahead.




</p><hr>


<p>
The fate of our planet can cause an extreme sense of discouragement due to the fact that it requires so much work to aid the planet in this climate war. The damage that has been done is catastrophic and our generation holds the power to induce change. Things will only get worse if there are no changed made and we contrinute to live our life without full regads to the planet.
<br><br>

Those who should definitely have the country's best interest at heart, do not. Without the country’s leaders on the planet's side, many individuals lose hope or fail to even believe that we are facing a climate crisis.  
<br><br>

After watching this video, I realized that I do not communicate with my parents and older family and community members as much as I should. II am very aware of what us as a society are facing in the near future, yet I have failed in passing on this information to older generations. I don not think that I have ever put much thought into this but hearing about parent-child inter-generational learning has prompted me to spread this knowledge to my older relatives and my younger relatives as well. This technique appears to be very efficient in helping mitigating climate change. Being introduced to a  small fact has the potential of triggering immense change and action in people so I would love to be a vessel of knowledge for the past generations as well as those to come.




</p><hr>


<p>
What does it mean to come to grips with the danger of the climate crisis? The lectures, “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” and “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” really dive into this question. As Ken mentions, we have already passed the time to have acted. I want to repeat that, we have already passed the time to have acted- let that sink in...
<br><br>

I think these lectures serve as a type of wake-up call. It’s easy to become frustrated with people that outright deny climate change or that doubt it enough to delay action, but our own inaction is a form of denial and that’s something we need to realize. The fact that we are in this class is a great start, but what are we actually doing in our individual lives to actually make a change? I really like when he says, “We need to fundamentally rethink and change the way that our species relates to this planet and we need to do it now.” I think part of the reason people are in denial is that we have become desensitized to our impacts on the ecosystems that we have come to dominate. In addition to that, we have grown indifferent to the toll on people everywhere, but especially in the poorest half of the world, where they have had  “virtually nothing to do with the climate crisis, yet will be suffering the most” as Ken puts it. 
<br><br>

The people responsible for the climate crisis simply don’t care about it. I have personally interacted with someone (in his 60s) that said there are too many environmentalists in Santa Barbara. And as I was explaining that there can never be enough with the impending climate crisis, we began debating on why the issue of climate change deserves the most attention, he concluded with the fact that even if things do get bad, he will not be alive to face the impacts. I responded with “but your children and your children’s children will.” 
<br><br>

The future really is in our hands.




</p><hr>


<p>

I completely agree with what Ken is saying about how we, the younger generation, need to take control of the planet (in a non-violent way, of course). I would dare to say that majority the older generation that ARE in power as of right now are greatly disconnected with how serious the climate crisis is, something that they largely contributed to. The way to combat this crisis would be to get voted into power, so one could have a platform where it's possible to pass some sort of legislation, just as the youngest woman ever voted into congress has done recently.

<br><br>

The main problem with this is that most people don't take younger people seriously. One example is Greta Thunberg, how the internet ridiculed her for her passion of saving the planet, something that everyone should be focused on right now. Hopefully, as the years go by, more and more of our younger generation would acquire some sort of platform to do some actual change that should have been done YEARS ago.



</p><hr>


<p>
In the lecture, the professor talked about the mistakes made by past generations has not been addressed clearly to the people that a lot of carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, but those generations did not make efforts to limit or decrease the damages. There has always been a frequently asked question, which is what can the students do to improve the environment and protect the planet. Professor gives the answer in this lecture that as the young generation, the thing we can do to make the Earth a better place is to take control of the planet. The situation of the environment issues are too urgent right now that people need to realize the problems and start taking actions now. So it is important to let the young generation who is more aware of the urgency of protecting the environment to take over the decision making process to make changes in the society. 
<br><br>

We need to realize that big business like fossil fuels companies are putting millions of dollars to protect their profits, but those profits means nothing if the environment becomes uninhabitable for human beings. And there are always things which are more valuable and important than money.




</p><hr>


<p>

As someone who responds better to practical approaches to problems with concrete means and methods, I was initially pessimistic and uninterested in the suggested strategies offered in this lecture video. Taking control and changing not only the political climate in the U.S. but also the culture of rampant consumerism propagated in most capitalist economies simply through activism and conversations? Seems too slow and unrealistic for an urgent issue like the climate crisis. The accelerating impacts of climate change will outpace any cultural change especially one on a global scale. Intergenerational education and discourse can only be successful if both parties have a somewhat comprehensive background on global history and the basic science of how climate change occurs. Aside from just the transfer of knowledge, communication and language barriers may be present between generations as well. 
<br><br>


However, the more I think about other possible solutions and ways to go about this problem, the more I realize, much to my frustration, that there aren't any. At the end of the day, I believe that we have to eliminate actors that are accelerating the effects of climate change either by force (which Ken doesn't reccomend) or by education and persuasion. It's not an answer I like to hear, but have to accept given the urgency that the climate crisis demands.



</p><hr>


<p>

The two videos are thoughtful. Ken brought up a lot of facts regarding two generations: the older generation has less consciousness about the climate crisis, and this is our job to talk with our parents, our grandparents about the climate change and global warming. Ken mentioned some useful suggestions, such as voting. Voting is a point I didn't think about which can be related to take control of climate crisis. Our generation can vote and has impact on politics, so we can use our power to switch the emphasize onto the climate. 
<br><br>
My high school physics teacher talked to me in a similar way. He said the future belongs to my generation. After decades they pass away, My generation has to deal with the climate crisis which the problem last generation remained. We need to think about ourselves and our children to live in a better life, so we have to take some actions to take control of the Earth. I like the way Ken said "moving forward to nature" and look ahead. We have already known the cause and effect of the climate change from last few months. The next step is focusing on the future how to deal with the climate crisis. In fact, any tiny improvements are good contributions. Thank you for making the videos.

The way you highlighted the battle that my and the coming generations must take on brings to mind an interesting sentiment among my generation that I've seen circulating on the internet. Often, I've seen people of my generation lament that we were born into a time in which things seem to have been relatively decided for us already, as encapsulated by the line that we were "born too late to explore the Earth, born to early to explore the universe, born just in time to explore dank memes". Obvious terrible joke aside, it communicates a kind of sorrow at the fact that our generation was born with no obvious frontier or exploratory challenge to conquer, and with the internet, we were lead to believe that that meant languishing and growing our own lives individually would be our chief purpose. The climate crisis, however, presents something new. Not to put a positive spin on a problem that is so overwhelmingly grim, but this is the problem that shall come to define our generation. Here is our frontier, here is our generational problem to champion. The climate crisis, borne from the generation before us and handed to us as the issue of our time lest we lose our lives and the lives of those coming after us to the mistakes of one generation, must serve as this generation's overarching goal. Those of us wandering about, painfully aware of the aimlessness of a meaningless existence, have a pressing issue glaring before us that we MUST confront and conquer. If my generation can unite under the common enemy of climate change, perhaps true change can be made.

The lecture videos before this one were instrumental in helping me learn the effects of the climate crisis, but this last video is heading toward a different direction. Ken is starting to talk more about what we can do to mitigate the worst of the climate crisis. It makes me believe that as we continue in this course we might discuss a lot more various ways we can help; I may be naive, but this gladdens me as it makes our future seem more optimistic.
<br><br>

It was difficult for me to imagine a world where my generation took control in the beginning but as the video went on it became easier. Ken gave the example of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the legislation she introduced to address the crisis. She is one the few of my representatives that I can relate to because of age and already she is taking action. Although I might not run for Congress in the future, I’m inspired to vote and try to let our generation’s voice be heard in the future.

I agree that the situation requires we generations to act immediately. However, I think obstacles will come in two major directions. It is really uncomfortable to think that (make a metaphor) as a son, you also need to pay your father’s debt and your own debt as well. It simply doesn’t appeal to logic. Just take the example professor provided in the lecture that encourages us to ride bicycles instead of driving cars EVEN IF THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEDICATED TO ROAD CONSTRUCTION. It is illogic to think about myself with great danger of being hit by cars, sweating just to protect the environment while a mid-age makes it in vain simply by stepping on it. Therefore, to conclude, the condition of our generation to act more is no longer to ask our father generation to set up a good model(as they already did it quite awful).It is that they should at least stop spoiling our contribution through excessive pollution. You need to maintain your living style, that’s fair, but do not do excessive pollution. Secondly, can the influences and the habits we generations get from our father generations be entirely abandoned in simply one generation? Not really. Imagine being a kid when your families never mentioned single words about climate change in your lifetime and instead, they encourage you to sport cars as entertainment. How can you indeed change the behavior? Not Really.

This lecture heavily emphasized that younger generations, such as mine (Gen Z), “need to take control of the planet” in terms of the climate crisis. The first solution that Ken states is “to vote and to urge five of your friends to do the same”. In 2018, before the midterm elections, I vividly remember that I tried to convince my friends to vote, however they were not interested at all. I felt like an older sister lecturing them on the importance of voting, but they seemed to not care, which is worrisome, especially because voting, according to Ken, is “one of the simplest, quickest, and most effective things that you can do…”.  Although, the other solution, “child to parent intergenerational learning” sounds like an effective way to educate older generations of the impact and importance of the climate crisis.

Ken bringing up the child-parent communication as a form of activism strikes really close to home for me. I'm an only child to two older parents who are apart of the boomer generation. I am fortunate that they're both fully aware of, and believe in, climate change, but I still can tell that they are product of the boomer generation when I do present more "radical" topics or ideas about combatting climate change to them. Both of my parents grew up in my hometown, and climate change is, to put it lightly, not a top priority for people there. I would argue most people in my hometown don't believe in climate change at all. Again, they both do try doing things to help the environment, like having solar panels on our home, using reusable bags, recycling, that sort of stuff. But they also often don't see the impact other choices have in the greater context; this is where the parent-child activism comes into play.
<br><br>

Because of this class, I've not only tried to implement more eco-concious habits into my daily life, but I'm also working on gently nudging my parents in that direction as well. It is most certainly a process that won't just magically happen in the span of one weekend, or likely even a month, but it's worth it to try, even just for our planet's sake.

In the “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” video it mentions how the older generation does not want to admit they let the climate crisis progress so much and decide to deny the fact that it has been progressing. It is very sad how Ken mentions that so many species are dying and suffering the consequences that humans created with the giant  emission of greenhouse gases over long periods of time. It is sad to think how many innocent people such as the poorer parts of the world who have barely contributed to any of the climate crisis will probably suffer its affects the most. The younger generation is taking notice and starting to take part of a movement for the climate crisis, but the older generation still has not. A agree with Ken on the idea that a lot of people from the older generation are in power right now and they do not want to admit they were in some part responsible for letting the climate crisis grow. Also the fact that the older generation care more about current problems that could affect their daily lives such as the economy and health care. Like Ken mentions since the older generation has not witnessed any real consequences of climate change throughout their lifetime, so the issue was not a priority. 
 <br><br>
 In the video, “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” I agree with Ken’s argument that the young generation can not wait to try to get the oldergenration to do something because that have done nothing over so many years. I think trying to get involved in politics and vote is a good way to advocate for the climate crisis and take action.  It was interesting to hear the fact that the younger generation was voting a lot more,yet I was not shocked to hear the fact that they were outvoted by the older generation. I do agree that lots of progress has occurred through protests and involvement politically, which is why it's a good approach. I do think it is important  for the younger generation to inform the older generation and let them know more information about the cris to get potentially more support.

While my generation may be the most concerned about the growing climate crisis, while older generations aren’t as concerned either because if the delay in consequences, simple denial of the crisis, or both, I wish the message of this video had been different. As you explained, in both the government and business, it is older people, from on average those 60-70, who are in power. I don’t think we can change that fact in any short amount of time, as you rightly suggested is necessary, solely through a voting movement. You said yourself that older generations are twice as likely to vote as young people, a gap made even worse by the fact that the population, on average, is getting older because of a decrease in birth rates.
 <br><br>
 I agree with you that violence is not the answer to this problem or any problem, but I do think a much more radical movement than you have proposed is necessary. Even if we did successfully vote younger, more climate-conscious policy makers into office in large enough numbers and quickly enough to make a sizable difference, what will this do to change corporate business practices, the driving force behind fossil fuel emissions? The largest companies in the world will still fund politicians to further their interests, and without major incentive to change the way they operate, they will still be able to do business as usual throughout the world. The more necessary movement will force politicians and CEOs alike to realize that they are on the wrong side of history, it will force corporations to operate sustainably lest they lose the support of consumers, it will force those already in power to push for stricter environmental regulations and new laws lest they be voted out of office. The movement that is necessary won’t just affect who gets into office, it will force the concerns of young people to be heard.

I really appreciated that Ken brought up the fact that the people in power (who actually have the ability to enact major changes toward the climate crisis) are inevitably the ones who are going to be less affected than the upcoming generations. This really tied in nicely to the idea of child-to-parent intergenerational education. While I have tried in the past to make my parents more aware on the issue of climate change, and have been met with nothing but anger and denial, I will try again and again until I can hopefully open their eyes. If they cannot realize for themselves that climate change may possibly ruin their children’s lives, and their grandchildren’s lives for certain, maybe hearing it from their offspring will spark some realization. 
  <br><br>

One person alone cannot mitigate this crisis. We know this. But if we can place someone into power who will set the foundations that will allow us to make changes to our fundamental ways of living, then I truly believe we do stand a fighting chance of saving our world before it is too late. One example that has been pressing on my mind recently is transportation. While it is easy to say “stop driving so much” in efforts of saving natural oil supplies, it is often difficult to avoid when there are little to no public transportation options in place. This is not something one person alone can change, but that a whole assembly of thought, planning, and funding needs to act upon. 
  <br><br>

We have made little changes here and there that have certainly not gone unseen; such as eliminating the use of plastic bags, plastic straws, and disposable plastic water bottles. However, this is simply not enough. We need to take the initiative that we brought forth to make these changes to a LARGER scale. We need to change eating habits to more primarily plant-based diets by making it convenient. By making it more difficult to NOT switch to these habits.  
  <br><br>

Just like in the 60s, when climate change activism actually brought forth change to the people in positions in power. While it is nice to think that this was caused by a simple spread of awareness, I believe that it was primarily caused due to it being more difficult for change NOT to occur. Because the violence and destruction of angry climate protestors was more difficult to ignore than to simply create change. While I am NOT saying that violence is the answer, and that peaceful protests are useless, I think that we need to make it more difficult for those in power to ignore our calls. We need to take control of this planet, and we need to work hard to do so.

Ken brings up a number of highly relevant points in this video. He communicates the urgency of the crisis and the immediate nature of the action that must be taken. I agree with his stance on the importance of voting. Ushering in a generation of new leaders that have the vision and drive to be able to take on the powerful interests standing against climate reform is incredibly important. However, I cannot completely stand behind the rhetoric that Ken uses about the climate crisis being an entirely generational issue. We often think about older people as representing a political community that is more conservative and less inclined for change, while younger people embody the progressive spirit and stance that we need to be able to mend our broken world. This demographic divide holds less water than we think, though. By far, the biggest indicator of what a person believes is what their parents believe. Young people are not more liberal or more progressive than their parents by a very wide margin. When we look at climate marches and high school walkouts, it may look like this is the case, but the truth is that most of those kids' parents would be supportive of their behavior because most of the time this action is occurring in liberal suburban or urban areas. The kids attending Paradise High would never walk out of school to protest climate change because they were instilled with certain values from their parents. I believe it is foolish to characterize the divide as one of age. More than anything, the divide is regional and political. While it is true that the average younger person's political views are marginally more left-leaning than that of older people, making this generalization seems unsustainable. One example of how this thinking could be dangerous is reflected in voting, the action that Ken believes is our most powerful tool at achieving a sustainable future. Examining the Democratic primary field for the 2020 American election, following the ageist line of thinking would lead to misguided conclusions. After hearing Ken talk about the "generational gap", I might be inclined to believe that the younger candidates running in the Democratic primary would be the most progressive and ambitious to fight climate change and other major issues. However, the candidate that would be the most brazen in taking on the fossil fuel industry and putting out concrete legislation to address climate change is Bernie Sanders, the oldest candidate in the field. While it would be easy to believe that a younger candidate, Pete Buttigieg for example, would have the fieriest and radical proposals, the opposite is true. Buttigieg and others are more hesitant to embrace radical change, while the most progressive candidates, Sanders and Warren, are both part of the generation that Ken labels as the "problem".

I highly agree with Ken on the fact that we need to change some of our political members not only locally but nationally because a lot of politicians are quite old and they do not have the same priorities on climate change as we do. Not all, but many have a very old school view on climate change. We need young members to go in and make decisions whether its just for Santa Barbara or the entire US, to change laws that will help us preserve our planet and reduce carbon emissions. Make it required to vote! This will make more teenagers want to cast their vote and it really will make a change. Thank you for believing in our generation because sometimes I don't even know if I do.

I quite enjoyed this video. It gave me hope, unlike most of the things I've read/watched in this and other environmental classes. First of all, Ken presented a clear goal for us, and in calling an entire generation to action suggested the unity that must occur. This is fundamentally different from all the other climate change mitigation strategies that have been suggested to me in the past. All of those stressed individual action, without really addressing the idea that combating global warming must be a societal effort. Additionally, I also think this approach to solving the climate crisis enables us to make our world better in many other ways while we're at it. Undoubtedly, the climate crisis can become an opportunity for change if we act swiftly and justly. There are so many issues that I know my generation wants to see addressed that go over looked. Taking control of our political processes and the power they bring is our chance to see those issues resolved. Climate change, I believe, affects our generations conscious more than we realize, and so I am optimistic that we will prioritize it once we fully understand what can and must be done. Also, I appreciated the nod to the 60's and Bobby Kennedy, as my grandmother is always telling me about the excitement and optimism of those times. I believe that spirit of belief that the world can be better is something we can once again capture, something we must once again capture.

As Professor Ken mentioned, the most important thing we can do to ensure a drastic change in policies, ones that will place the well-being of our planet first, is to vote. Vote for those candidates who truly want a green positive change, vote for those who will protect our planet and its ecosystems. We can no longer wait for others to act on our behalf, we don't have the privilege to have others act and demand changes for us. That option is no longer available as we are running out of time. The clock is ticking and as every day passes by, it just seems to speed up. 
  <br><br>


We can no longer place our hopes on the older generation to change, they, unfortunately, won't. Otherwise, they would have already. They don't feel the same fear we do, they will soon be gone and have nothing to worry about. They won't have to live with what they have created, but we will. Therefore every small change counts, as long as we start as soon as possible. We still have hope, we still have time.

I really like how Ken emphasized that NOW is the time to act and that we cannot wait another minute to do so. I am also a fan that he said VOTE and tell 5 friends to do the same. I strongly believe in the power of the pyramid scheme, not in the sense of a scheme, but it's end effect. If you yourself goes vegan or practices minimalism, that is great for the planet, but if you tell 5 of your friends about it and they follow through and become vegans, and most importantly they tell 5 of their friends that follow through, soon enough it will be popular and cool to be vegan and practice minimalism and meat consumption and consumerism will DIE.

The short lectures consisted of new information that shows us why the older generations do not believe in climate change. We millennials are currently in a place where we can’t do much. Yes, we have to take action, but its impossible to make a change when the majority of the people who are in charge don’t see an issue. As said in the video, the federal government is composed of older people between the ages of 60 to 70, with that said, they don’t address the crisis. The older generations simply turn the other way since they won’t be the ones suffering the consequences. The sad thing about the denial is that they don’t care about the underdeveloped countries who suffer, the wildlife, and us, the young people.

  <br><br>

We have to take action before its too late and end up making the issue worse. In this lecture we see that people aged 75 and higher don’t worry about climate change, making it number 23 on their list. They simply don’t care, and it’s sad to say but they’ll be dead shortly and they were the main contributor to this and don’t see it affecting them. Then we have Gen X, ranking climate change number 15 out of 29. They appear to care more than the baby boomer, which is a good thing.  I lastly want to say that I love the support we are getting from you, Ken and the motivation to take action now before its too late, Thank you.

It is scary to think of the huge pressure this generation has to do something about climate crisis. We have to save Earth not just for the future of our kids but our own. We will experience the effects of climate change first hand. And honestly all I can think about is what if we what we do is not enough. What happen to us and our kids then. However, these thoughts will not stop me from trying to do something about it. I will vote and talk to my parents about it because they do not even know how their lifetime is affecting mine. After watching this video all I can think about is educating my nieces and nephews about this global crisis since my parents didn't teach me about it. I want to teach them to start caring about the Earth at a young age so they can improve their lifestyle and take control.

What caught my attention in this video was the idea of the child to parent intergenerational learning. Normally its the parents teaching their children but in some aspects of life, I believe that a parent can greatly benefit from learning from their children as they will both see something but from different perspectives. While watching the film on the fire in Paradise, I kept telling my mom all about it and she kind of just didn’t seem that interested. I told her about wanting to change my diet because of all of the things that I am learning from this class. She kept telling me how changing my diet wouldn’t do anything. From this experience I realized how this child to parent intergenerational learning could teach both the child and parent so much. But I think that there could be more to this parent child dynamic. I feel that I could not only attempt to teach my parents something but also my siblings. I have an older brother who always tells me to “stay woke” and this is my attempt to do so, opening my eyes to issues facing my generation and future generations. While I was watching the lecture videos my little brother sat with me but he only knew that he was learning about the weather. As a 9 year old he got bored very quickly, my older brother came in and he asked what I was watching and after I told him and he began telling me how he doesn’t think climate change is real because he has watched some videos on why it isn't. So while I think that child to parent teaching is a great idea, it would be a great idea as well to teach others in your family as well.

After watching both of Ken’s lectures, I couldn’t help but notice that the lecture “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis,” stood out to me the most. When Ken states that one of the most productive collective actions that exists in regards to promoting climate crisis is “child to parent intergenerational learning”, I noticed that is the strategy I have been using my entire life, especially when I speak to my family members about political issues. After watching the documentary Before the Flood last week, I had never really considered how my lifestyle negatively affects the planet. However, after watching the film, I couldn't help but feel guilty and ignorant about my actions. I decided to show my parents the film this weekend and after I shared my views and feelings about the climate crisis with them. I’d like to think this “child to parent intergenerational learning” was effective because I noticed my parents were extremely interested in the film and were able to see how important this issue is, especially realizing how it will affect future generations more. 
  <br><br>

I really enjoyed how in the lecture Ken encourages the youth to spread the message and take action. He encourages students to take control of the planet and use our rights to bring positive change. One of the issues I face when it comes to the climate crisis is that I never know what immediate action I should take, however, one important action I know is crucial to this is voting. I like how Ken states the importance of voting and how we should encourage at least 5 other friends to vote, which I think is a great idea. While I know the importance voting has and look forward to doing it once again this year, I plan on implementing the get 5 other friends to vote idea. However, while I think it is important to note encouraging younger voters to vote in order to have a larger turnout is crucial, we need to acknowledge that this is not enough and should not be solely relied on us. It is crucial for movements to continue and cause political pressure to move towards change to hopefully change older generations perspectives, but it is also their responsibility to listen, be open minded and take immediate action.

I appreciated the idea of Ken having a very approachable quality to him, and his attitude towards helping us embrace climate change as our issue to solve. I truly do think however that it's about time that the older ways of running a company have expired, especially when it is being run unsustainably. I believe that we need to take a stand, but that's almost impossible with the leadership that is present in today's day and age. We need to run these older people out of office and have them own up for their mistakes. I thought that it was interesting that Ken brought up the method of talking to your parents and helping them understand the problem, however at some point,  I truly believe that people will be too far gone in an opposite direction to see any form of a point of return. These lectures however did provide a sense of urgency for me and I feel much more motivated to watch my generation fight for what's right in congress.

As Ken’s lectures mention, and as the current political climate shows, it is clear that the responsibility of fighting against climate change falls on the shoulders of my generation. It is difficult to even accurately articulate how unjust it is that we must fight for control over our planet when we are the ones that will be suffering the consequences of the actions of the people who are currently in control. As much as I want to believe that we can make real political change by voting on policy, it is hard to have faith in a system that is largely controlled by third-party interests who have no intention of allowing any significant policy reform and who have more than enough money to push their own agendas. 
  <br><br>


However, as Ken brought up, we are seeing new candidates running for office who are pushing for real change. My hope is that if we can get these candidates elected, who refuse to be bought out by corporations, we can change the system from the inside. I think that the concept of child-to-parent intergenerational learning can play a huge role in this. We have the power and the supporting evidence to influence and teach our parents, especially when it comes to an issue that will have a huge impact on their children and grandchildren. If we can change the way our parents vote and combine this with our own votes, hopefully we can have enough of a voice to drown out those who refuse to acknowledge that climate change exists and those who refuse to take action in order to advance their own interests.



</p><hr>


<p>
I agree with what Ken says that climate change existed many years ago, but people didn’t realize it, even governments didn’t treat it seriously because the changes are not quite obvious to let people feel a strong sense of worrying. But today, climate change has been one of the most common topic mentions among people, and we are having a class to learn and promote it. This not only shows the urgency of reducing climate change, it also tells us that because of the lack of actions from the generations before us, the greater responsibility is now on us, and we must put in actions before it is too late to save our future.

In the lecture video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis”, instead of providing specific ways to slow down the climate crisis, professor Ken told the audiences how to enlarge one person’s impact to more people socially. I think it is the most efficient way at present. Indeed, one person’s power is too weak. One strong environmental activist
cannot win an inactive generation who do nothing, even continuing damaging the environment. As a result, trying to affect the government policy is a better way. Based on Ken’s video, more young generation people vote for the policies which are good to the local environment. However, still two third old generation people vote for their own rights. Of course, people need to treat themselves best, but I think people should also think about others like their children, their unbirth grandchildren. As I just mentioned, one person’s power is weak, also
strong. The children to parent intergenerational learning is something the policies cannot reach. It is the heartfelt movement and originates from love. Children teach their parents about the real condition of the planet, analyzing the severe problems and how important their votes are to their kids. This kind of way is the easiest way to change old generation peoples’ minds to gradually make more people vote for the planet. If the old generation people cannot take control of the planet, it is our duty, as the residents of this planet, to take control of

I am all about fixing problems. I hate being given a problem without ways to solve it. I'm eager for the upcoming videos I will watch for solutions. I love the idea of child to parent teaching. I think this could be extremely important that every student should try doing it with their parents. It may be a challenge to some, even me. My dad tends to ignore climate change. Maybe he just doesn't want to acknowledge the fact that he and his generation screwed us over. They don't want to face the reality that they are failures to us. My dad is supposed to protect me and support me, but he and his generation are not doing that at all. Before taking this class I never had enough knowledge about it to communicate with my dad about the harsh reality of climate change. Now that I do, the next time I see him I will be sure to sit down with him and talk to him about the consequences of climate change and what me and my generation will have to do to go against all odds and stop climate change from destroying us forever.

<p>
What was most interesting to me in this lecture was the child to parent influence that Ken was talking about. 

  <br><br>

This impacted me the most because he talks about how the older generation has much more of a control on democracy currently than the younger generation does.  2/3 of people over 65 vote when around 1/3 of people in my generation vote. 

  <br><br>

I enjoy the fact that Ken talked about a nonviolent impact on the older generation. Being almost Martin Luther King Junior Day,  we need to make an impact in a peaceful way because if we make it in any other way it will affect our impact negatively. Because the older generation is in control of democracy today and will be for the next several years, we need to make an impact on the older generation and attempt to teach them how much of a problem climate change is today. 

  <br><br>

Until the younger generation(which is the generation that is most concerned about climate change) is taking ahold of politics in our country, we need to make as much of an impact as we can nonviolently. We need to shout as loud as we can to show our voice.

I completely agree with how important intergenerational learning is to help fight the climate crisis. I have made many personal lifestyle changes, such as becoming a pescatarian, replacing single use items with reusable ones, and becoming a conscious consumer, but I think one of the most important things I have done is started a conversation with my own parents about ways they can help combat climate change to help future generations. My mom for example has stopped buying plastic water bottles, a very common purchase for her and started using her own reusable water bottle. My dad has cut out meat from his diet and has switched to eating more plant based foods. Although these seem like small changes I think that every individual effort makes a difference, or at least helps start a conversation. It also gives me hope that my parents are willing to make these changes and others even though they grew up in a generation where they did not think twice about these things. 
  <br><br>

Another part of this video that I found very interesting and agree with is that we need to reshape Western culture. I think that the consumer culture we have known our whole lives is having a profound and detrimental impact on our environment and in order to prevent further damage we need to reinvent our societies and the way they function. I think people are scared that if we don't support consumerism our GDP decrease and our economy will suffer but I think there are ways in which we can live sustainably and still be one of the most powerful countries. Lastly, not only do I believe that becoming a more conscious consumer will benefit the environment but I think it will have positive impacts on peoples mental health and make them more aware of what truly brings them happiness and not instant gratification that subsides quickly.

I understand that climate change is here and its consequences are rapidly displaying itself. But what caught my attention in this video was your main concern for the future and how they will have to deal with our mistakes. While I am a part of the new generation, it is frightening to assume that we may be in the last few decades of human existence. However, as you mentioned, there is still time to mitigate the climate crisis. While I do carry fear, I also feel somewhat hopeful knowing there are a few ways I can help like voting, biking instead of driving, having a vegan diet,  and so forth. 
  <br><br>
It was also interesting to hear you admit that the climate crisis was not really an issue for your generation, but will be a defining issue for mine. Fortunately, people are becoming more aware of human action and how it may affect the environment. Our history, and especially within this era, has proven humans to be capable of change. Although slowly, marginalized communities are being recognized and more laws are being made, rights are being given, to protect these groups. Who says we can't do the same for the environment? for older generations? And you mention all of this in an eye-opening way. It is interesting to look back at my life and my actions now and see it influence those around me like my parents, a phrase referred to as "child to parent intergenerational education and connection." Although it's in the smallest things, I really do believe that with a bit of knowledge and just becoming aware of our direct effect on the environment, humans can change our destiny.

After viewing the online lectures, I feel conflicted about how we, as a generation, can and will proceed with the ongoing issue that is climate change. As mentioned in the lecture, many of the people who are in power of the country are of the older generation–ranging from CEOs of big companies and politicians, to those who hold most of the voting power in the United States. With such little power residing in the younger generation, there is not much we can do on a political scale. Sure we can have social movements and pressure politicians to take climate change more seriously, but how much of us will really rise to the occasion when it comes down to it? Even when it comes to bigger and more successful social movements such as “Me Too” and “Black Lives Matter”, there is still so much more progress to be made in getting people to join the collective effort and support the movement. How much more for climate change will we be able to stand together in solidarity when most of the older generations view the issue as less important and will be less willing to fight against it? Although I now see the repercussions and severity of climate change, there are still so many young people who are not fully aware of the dangerous situation that we are all in. I know that before taking this class, I would have been less willing to join in a protest or social demonstration that was for climate change. For these reasons, I am apprehensive about how my generation will respond to and handle the issue of climate change in the near future. However, I know that I should not let this discourage me and my efforts in combating such an issue and that I too need to start taking a stand and stop being a bystander. 

  <br><br>

With this aside, there were a lot of points brought up in the lectures that I found so be interesting points of conversation. The first is how the older generations are less concerned with climate change and will suffer the least from it, but are the ones who did nothing about it and let it get this bad in the first place. To be completely honest, it scares me to think that because of the time delay, we are the ones who will suffer the consequences and our future children's generation may be left even worse. But yet, the ones who are in influential positions and hold a majority of the voting power are the ones deciding the policies, laws, and political/government action of today. These videos really opened my eyes to how much my generation needs to wake up and start taking responsibility and power into our own hands. And I believe that this starts with improving the voter turnout of our generation and increasing the education we receive on environmental, social, and political issues. By doing so, there will be less resistance in our fight against the advancement of global warming. 
  <br><br>


The other point that I found interesting was the idea of child-to-parent intergenerational learning. By transferring our knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors from this generation to our parents, we can definitely make a change in not only the climate crisis problem, but in many other areas as well, such as the current socio-political climate of today’s society. I believe through intergenerational learning, we can work to educate the older generations by challenging their preconceptions and giving them a new perspective on things. I like this idea because it shows that there are things in which everyone can learn from someone else–regardless of age and experience–and that there is a continual flow of ideas between the different generations. All in all, I do not think that it is helpless to fight against climate change, but if we are to preserve the Earth, we have to act now.



</p><hr>


<p>

I believe that this video made an important point that intergenerational communication and planning is necessary to create effective action that will slow the effects of climate change. I often hear of people in their twenties and thirties teaching their families about sustainability. I believe that there has to be a stronger push among the younger generation to encourage our older family members switch to more sustainable life styles. Yes, the climate crisis is inevitably going to effect not only our lives, but our children’s lives and generations to come. Our parents must realize that the future of their grandchildren is in their hands. 
  <br><br>
Along with communication across generations, voting and creating local change is necessary to prevent climate change from creating more devastating results. However, I believe that people should look into creating change now rather than waiting for the local governments to form sustainability plans. Through these efforts, more political officials will realize the importance of sustainability efforts, and our generation will be able to move towards a greener future without the worries of climate change deniers holding positions in the future.

<p>
OK, just wanna say some things I have thought of that our generations can do:
  <br><br>
1. We learn to manage the trash, building a more complete cycle. We consume the trash we made by ourselves, not nature.
  <br><br>
2. We can separate human living spaces and pollution spaces. All pollutions are controlled in designated areas; no factories or other pollution cause beyond that area.
  <br><br>
3. Find alternate energy resources, which is what our society is doing now.
  <br><br>
 Something we should not do:
  <br><br>
Just one: Crying on the internet and SAYing how much we care about the environment but DO nothing. Even going to learn some basic knowledge about how we can change our environment in the future is more helpful than criticizing and crying how others have killed our living spaces.

Yes, I think it must be acknowledged that every person who wants to mitigate climate change should be taking individual actions to help reduce their impact on the environment. People can acknowledge climate change, but rather than placing the blame, and thus responsibility, onto others, acting on the matter itself is the only real solution. It is odd to think that, in today's society, simply not being a climate change denier seems to be enough "action" in helping the environmental movement. Like Ken said, the issue of climate change must be acted upon now; it is too urgent a matter to put off despite the nature of time delays in seeing the consequences of climate change. Voting, educating others, and other means of influence are important, but a reduction of carbon footprint from things like plant-based diets, less use of cars, and zero waste initiatives are also ways to help the planet.

This lecture was very inspirational in the sense that professor Ken being from the generation of baby boomers who created all this climate mess is an activist for climate change, warning us and educating us about the dangers of rapid temperature increase. He acknowledges the fact that his generation did not act at the time that was an essence for preventing global warming and suggest that we be the generation to change that by taking control of the situation. Professor Ken makes a great valid point that it is now up to us to decide and act upon how we want our future to look. Taking control of the issue can be seen in many different ways, an extraordinary example is voting like professor Ken mentioned older people are voting twice as much than younger people and that is an issue for the concern for climate change. Older people are less likely to vote on policies that care for our environment because they will no longer live to see the sufferings and disasters global warming brings. On the other hand, younger people need habitual earth for their own security and their future offsprings. Which is why we need to take control of this climate crisis and vote as much as we can. Many young people decide not to vote because they believe they are not well informed of politics to be voting but as long as we are aware of the situation and are educated on the dangers of CO2 we can make a change by informing our friends, family, and others to vote. I believe we can be the ones to change the issue of climate or at least lessen it to prevent major suffering by taking control of the world.

I appreciate Ken’s honesty in these lecture videos just as everyone else mentioned. The vulnerability and the humility to admit that his generation was responsible for the crisis that this generation faces is a huge step towards engaging this generation to making an impact and taking control. His radical solution for this generation to take complete control of the climate crisis including changing our entire materialistic lifestyle is as he described, insanely radical. 
  <br><br>

Admitting fault to the climate crisis puts this generation at some ease, but then expecting us to face the consequences head on is almost like a slap in the face. We’ve been conditioned to have this lifestyle and our entire society and economy is built around this materialistic lifestyle dependent on fossil fuels and items to bring us that “fulfillment”. While I am all for it and am easing myself into that culture change, I don’t have much faith that my generation will be able to accomplish this.

I agree that beginning to take control and reshaping our culture and economy is really radical, but I also find it really great that a lot of this can be done through relatively non-radical day-to-day actions. Things like voting, talking to your older relatives, and making small changes in your own actions and lifestyle can start to impact so much more than you believe. While the climate crisis needs to be addressed by globalized action, I believe effective change will stem from small, grassroots movements coming together to solve issues in their own communities and reforming their culture.

  <br><br>

I agree that this task seems overwhelming and daunting, but I do have faith in our generation's ability to start this movement successfully if we focus on individualizing our approaches to solving climate change by making this happen through organizing locally.

From these two videos, I get to know that the older generations, or the baby Boomers, are still in a large portion in the society, and most of them still do not believe in the severity of climate change. And in fact, they are the ones who should carry the responsibility for the damage they’ve done to the environment and nature; as the video mentioned, 1/3 of the global carbon emission are resulted from them. However, as the young, we should not wait for them to be awake, and we have to face the reality and start to address it because this is closely related to our own future. One specific method that was mentioned in lecture is voting, which enables the young also have an opportunity to control the older generation.



</p><hr>


<p>
I believe voting is extremely important for my generation to take action. I know a few of my friends don't believe voting can actually make a difference so they are not registered. I discuss the impact of voting with them very often to convince them to go to the polls. We must flood the polls with environmentally conscious people and reevaluate which national and global issues we should base our voting on. Healthcare is important, social security is important, but none of that will matter if we do not have a habitable planet. Our economy will not matter when everyone's lives are at stake.

It makes sense why the older generations, those who were essentially the main contributors to climate change, have not, for the most part, been acting on the climate crisis. There was no “climate crisis” talked about in the media, politics, or school during their upbringing and most of their lives, so they have never seen the climate as an urgent issue. They’ve also never experienced the effects of climate change firsthand, due to the time delay that Ken has explained. While a lot of younger people are angry and upset with the older generations for helping to bring about the climate crisis, I believe it’s important to have some sympathy and understanding for them. We as human beings are not perfect, and it’s not like most people of the older generations are genuinely malevolent or purposefully trying to hurt the environment or others. We should be upset with those that have been at the head of oil companies, or those that have been corrupting politics, but I don’t think we should be blaming a generation of people as a whole, because most ordinary people really had no idea what was going on and weren’t educated about it. We shouldn’t create the narrative of one generation being bad, while another is good. That is just not nuanced enough nor fair.
  <br><br>

I think in order to save life on earth from the climate crisis, we need to be having honest conversations within our families. We need to be educating one another and supporting one another. We need to discuss climate change in terms of science and fact, not opinion, and view the topic as less partisan. Also, like Ken said, we need to participate in democracy and vote if we wish to see a change, and change our own lifestyle factors like meat consumption and car usage. While I do see a lot of hope for my generation, as we are becoming educated on climate change and inciting change and conversation, I still think we take part in a lot of environmentally detrimental behaviors and many people aren’t going to change - because the lifestyle changes required are uncomfortable and maybe not as luxurious as we’re used to in a first world, developed country.

<p>
After watching the two lecture videos, I find it interesting that the fate of this world depends on our generation and the future. I agree with Ken in that we have a role in educating older generations in order for them to acknowledge the truth about climate change and its dangerous impacts instead of pointing fingers. I think the greatest opportunity to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is by being politically active and voting for a change in the larger system.  I believe that we will be the difference for our world and bring about change needed for climate change. We need to act now before it is too late. Climate change will affect everyones life, even continuing generations including our children and grandchildren. But also, everyones actions will affect the Earth too - for better or for worse.


</p><hr>


<p>
I was surprised at first when I heard Ken say that we need to take control now if we want a chance to save the planet. But after thinking about it makes sense. I figured we would finally start making a change in 2040 and beyond due to our age and the age of most politicians in power. It is interesting to realize that we actually have the possibility to change the political landscape in the US and elect who we need in certain positions regardless if they have decades of experience.

<p>
Ken, I very much appreciated your explanation of how much political and societal influence your generation has had on our current state of affairs with respect to climate change; I underestimated just how much that sphere of influence extended. However, now I have a clearer picture as to why we aren't doing enough for the planet at the moment, even after the signing of the Paris Accords. I'm glad to see more and more of my peers registering to vote as they realize their personal political impact; I can only hope that they all have climate change at the forefront when it comes time to go to the polls. Even over the course of these past few weeks, I have noticed that I make more thoughtful decisions in various areas of my life that impact the planet, from online shopping to my cooking and diet. It feels good knowing that I am at least trying to do my part, however significant it may be in the grand scheme of things. It's quite annoying that society not only views climate change as a generational issue but also a partisan one. I can't understand how the most universal issue on the planet can be so divisive. We don't have the time to be skeptical of the overwhelming piles of evidence asserting climate change has been occurring for years and it's entirely caused by humans. Obviously, 7.8 billion humans are going to exert a sizeable degree of influence on Earth; we have shaped this planet to our liking and essentially conquered it, without any regard for how exactly we reached where we are currently. It's about time we start thinking about the consequences of human activities candidly and collectively do something to steer us in the right direction; our words are meaningless without tangible action to back them up.

These two lectures showed the difference between the two generations. In sixty years, we might be a generation that is being taught about in lectures. We can be a generation who continues to live our daily lives with all of our materialistic happiness or this can be a time of change and the starting point of making the Earth stay inhabitable. Ken pointed out that his generation knew exactly what they were doing to the climate. They were setting examples of how humans are “supposed” to act. Our generation is passionate enough to change this and persuade the younger generations to a more sustainable way of life. It is very worrisome that there is a minimal amount of voters my age. But, I also understand at the same time. We have been raised that old men will have the power regardless of what we say or do, therefore, many of my peers opt out of voting. They don’t think they have a big enough impact to make a difference. I think it is important that Ken stated the small number of votes around our age. This shows the audience that we are not making a difference because of our lack of numbers, not that the older generations have control of the vote outcomes. Recent events, such as Greta Thunberg’s rise, have shown the impact of my generation. She has the support of the majority of my generation and a great number of older generations. Like stated, the older generations might believe in climate change, but they will not be as affected me and my children. 
  <br><br>

I think it is important that we speak to our parents and grandparents about these issues and ask them how they want our children to grow up. We need to bring attention to the lack of food and the quality of air that our children and their children will encounter. There does need to be an immediate change, this has been said for many years now and there has been little effort to make a difference. No one wants to give up their steak for grandchildren's future. That is why it is up to the younger generations, with the mentally stable older generations aid, to make a difference.

“Fire in Paradise” presents one of the consequences of the climate crisis. The climate crisis besides wildfire has influence us a lot more and will continuously influence our generations. So what should we do? Ken gives us some solutions that I really agree with. We should definitely vote more. We need to let more and more people know the facts and change the whole policy to promote the use of renewable energy, to live in a more environmentally friendly life style. We should take actions right now instead of waiting for the next generation, because there is no time to wait. From the article, “2 degree Celsius: beyond the limit”, and the documentary, we should have the general sense of how severe the climate crisis is. we should start now to save ourselves. I decide to start with reducing buying unnecessary stuffs with my families and tell them what I learned and watched during the class. I hope more and more people could realize the problem and start taking actions with us.

</p><hr>


<p>
Watching these two lecture videos have provided me with hope on the issue at hand and has given me a sense of duty to take action for this issue. I took Ken's English 22: Literature and the Environment class my first quarter as a first-year and it provided me an insight on what I could do to limit climate change, such as changing to a vegetarian diet. This surprisingly was not hard for me to do and I aiming to become a vegan for health reasons and for the environment. 

  <br><br>

Moreover, the suggestion made on how to go about this issue through young people like me going to polls and making our voice heard is especially important to make a change because we can have a significant influence in the elections. Collective action is also equally important because of the pressure that would be put on politicians to make a change due to the demands being put forth by us. 
  <br><br>


Lastly, I think the child to parents intergenerational education is of the utmost importance because of the ability to influence our parents. Just imagine if each and every one of us talked to our parents/guardians about this issue, we could shift the perspective of an entire generation, which could help get action taken swiftly to mitigate this crisis. There is action needed to be done at this very moment and we can do what is needed to be done to solve the issue.

I agree that the child to parent communication of the climate crisis between the generations is very important. As our parents children we have some influence over them. By informing them about so much about the climate crisis that could make them be more considerate on how the vote for certain things having been exposed to more knowledge.

At this point I really just feel like the Paris Climate Agreement was a joke. How has it been effective at ALL if CO2 emissions have gone from 0.5% per year, to 2.7%?!! I think this goes to show how nifty politicians can be in strategically easing their constituents. For now, all the Paris Climate Agreement seems to be is a big hoax; it seems like it is intended to make a difference and help us believe that it will, but in reality it has no real power or accountability. The Agreement really gave me hope, but seeing how ineffective it’s been I’m now just upset with it. 
   <br><br>
In addition to my mini-rant, I would like to acknowledge that the first lecture video, and this one following, bring up some really enlightening and helpful information. First off, the fact that the majority of people with power and a real influence on environmental policy are much older than the generation (mine) that is going to have to endure the consequences of climate change. The majority of power is with people ages 56-60 and. It makes sense that the issues most important to this age group: social security, healthcare, and the economy are issues relevant to them, but this in turn does nothing to help the rest of the world that they have ruined and are leaving everyone else stuck with. 
  <br><br>
I see Professor Hiltner’s ways to do something against climate change as a challenge. And I mean a challenge as in one that I want to take up. Already I’ve started conversations with my parents, especially my dad who is a business owner, and I’ve really tried to get him to see the urgency of the situation. In addition, I have hope going into this next election that someone with some real passion will win and can take us in the direction we so desperately need. I strongly advocate the importance of voting to my friends and cannot wait to do so myself.

<p>

After watching these two videos, my initial reaction was to think that it is unfair that my generation will be the one that has to face the adverse effects from the actions of the previous generation. It is frustrating to know that not only is it up to us to create change and make attempts to fix these issues, but the same people who have caused this mess are the same ones who are working against us to do so. I feel like the older generation doesn’t see the climate crisis as an urgent cause to get behind because they will most likely not be here to experience when things truly get bad and start to get out of hand. While the solution of getting the younger generation to vote may seem like an easy thing to accomplish, I don’t believe it will happen all that quickly. Some teenagers/adolescents I know of won’t go out and vote because they are lazy and don’t want to go out of their way to go to the polls. Another reason I hear for their lack of voting is that their vote won’t even matter. But it’s clear to me and it should be to them to, that our vote does matter in numbers so we can elect the figures and the policies that will impact our future and slowly start removing the older generation’s ingrained ideas and their denial of the climate crisis.

I've got mixed feelings towards this comment (though I do appreciate it, and it is well thought out!). I think as a member of the younger generations that Ken is clearly talking to as a member of an older generation, I definitely received the message: young people need to take over the world. And I also felt the same frustration that you (commenter above) mentioned. He used the 1960s youth rebellions and child-to parent intergenerational learning. Notably, he says "You do not have decades. you do not even have years," which makes this goal feel impossible. How are we supposed to flip the government (by either convincing or ousting the climate deniers) in just a few years? I emphasize strongly with the teens who don't vote and disagree with your characterization of them as "lazy".
   <br><br>
The idea of taking political power is fundamentally flawed in my opinion. Now, I’m absolutely going to vote, and I encourage others to do the same, as it does lead to noticeably improved policies. (Note: improved does not mean *good*) However, I’m worried that the fight for political power will a) fall out of touch with the working class or be co-opted and/or b) will lead to complacency on the part of the constituency. Unfortunately, the movement doesn’t end with putting our favorite politicians in office. As history has demonstrated time and time again (e.g. LGBTQ rights), the politician in power doesn’t matter as much as the strong grassroots movements holding them accountable. Not to say that politicians are inherently bad people..but there IS a reason for the stereotype that politicians lie. We need to put equally as much energy into organizations and collectives that directly advocate or make progress on the issues as we do into voting. 
   <br><br>
Despite my disagreements with both this comment and Ken's video, I would rate them both 9/10. This is a practical way to stop climate change, and writing this from early 2020, it seems like we may have the momentum to actually do this.

I find it interesting how one of the main issues with climate change is a generational gap. Literally a generational gap, a difference in age groups is a main part of what is keeping us so behind in progress. To me, thats crazy because it should never be an age problem because it applies to not only my generation but the children and grandchildren of YOUR generation. I think it's funny because Americans grow up in a society where we hold the idea of family and the protection of our family dear to our hearts, especially your generation where the picture perfect American ideal is a family who loves and protects each other. However, all of a sudden things have changed and that generation seems to feel that it's not their problem to deal with since they probably won't be alive to experience the disasters yet to come. It's funny how just like that morals are quickly dropped for business and money and opinions are chosen over brutal facts to curve guilt.

Listening to the proposed strategies that Ken talked about gave me hope. I believe that we will be the generation to bring about the change needed to eventually end climate change. Although coming from a family of immigrants some of these strategies are hard to accomplish. The Child to parent intergenerational education and connection seems like a great idea but my parents cannot vote in this country. Instead of being let down, I have decided to inform my parents about how meat consumption is one of the biggest contributors to climate change. I have also informed them about how they could be more eco friendly and reduce their waste. When I initially brought up the idea to reduce meat in our household I was laughed at. Meat is a very big part of my parents culture and is something they have always been taught to eat. However, when I  presented them with replacements for meat they were a little intrigued and decided to try it out. Our household has also moved from dairy products to dairy free products like oat milk. These are small changes for my family to make but nonetheless they help out the planet a little bit.
    <br><br>

Ken's talk about taking control was very motivating. It is also people like AOC that gives me hope that once the younger generation takes over, bigger changes can be implemented. However, I know that It will take a while for the younger generation to take over. So for now I have decided to continue to change my diet until I can eventually be Vegan. I have also decided to vote and encourage my siblings and friends to vote. I will not only make my voice heard through voting but through rallies and protests. Change is coming whether the older generation likes it or not.



</p><hr>


<p>

It's crazy to think that the fate of the world is most likely in our hands. The times of "danger and uncertainty" that Ken presents through the material so far will force us as a generation to find a solution that will allow our inner-will to survive to be a success. In our way stands uninformed politicians, clogged policy implementation, consumer culture, and a craving for convenience that is only growing. Things like amazon now will allow us to get deodorant from our beds in less than 2 hours, but the environmental effect of the factories and the transportation needed is soon to be our demise as a society. For the first time in a long time, the current generation is faced with a challenge that should be bi-partisan/non-political but rather one that a matter of life or death(literally). When those of color finally had enough, it took many a generation to come together and make change in terms of social change. Similarly, the climate crisis of today needs to be a bigger issue than me or you, with only the goal of saving our planet being on our minds. Things like reducing carbon emissions and going to a plant based diet will definitely be a start, but the real solutions will have to come from the human ingenuity that has resolved many a problem in the past. With all the advances being made in today's society, we as the human race will have to dig ourselves of the hole we have been thrown in, whether we like it or not.



</p><hr>


<p>
First of all, let me acknowledge that we have a huge burden, as Ken said, but what is the alternative that we face? It is in the face of such adversity that success counts the most, and any measurable success that any one of us can achieve is laudable. Honestly, the developed world has given the planet this problem, but ironically also the blueprint for a solution: the pyramid scheme. 
    <br><br>
Behind the curtain of hilarity that pyramid schemes may be humanity’s saving grace, resides the core principle that each person has to sell the idea of making a difference to as many people as they can, and the more people you can sell the idea to, the greater your reward, the greater impact we can have. If each person in this class posts on social media about these lectures and encourages people to vote, both on social media and in person, with the caveat that each person who wants to help has to do the same, it will result in astronomical change.



</p><hr>


<p>
With hope and faith, our generation has the power to reverse the damage caused by climate change. As Ken mentioned, through voting, conscious consumerism, and other choices, we can help create a new world! I think that optimism is a powerful tool that can shift any situation. We have the choice to view climate change as either a burden or an opportunity for unity. If we choose to look at climate change as an opportunity for unity, we can not only create a more eco friendly world, but we can also create an earth in which people are more connected to each other. I also loved how Ken talked about child to parent intergenerational education. It's common for people to view those who have lived longer as having more knowledge. However, in reality, everyone, no matter their age, has different wisdoms to offer. When communicating with older people about climate change, I think its important to remember that some people won't embrace it. Do not get discouraged when people don't embrace it. Similarly, do not get angry at deniers. Just continue forward and share your truth. I also think that going into it with a mindset to live an authentic life according to your truths is more beneficial than seeking to convince people to believe in your truths. When people are told what to do, they aren't as open. If you just live an authentic eco-friendly life I feel as though you will have a greater effect on the environment as people will be inspired by how you live and will be more opened to living a life similar to you!

I am extremely eager to start this series on what action I can take myself to battle this crisis. I discovered my embarrassing ignorance when I started this class and although frightening, it has been fascinating to dive deeper into this crisis and why it is happening. I already have a much better understanding of the concept and its devastating impacts across the globe, and each new thing I learn only makes me more anxious to learn about what I can do to help. Voting would not be first on my list of things I could do to contribute, but I now see that is the easiest way for our generation to start switching our nation’s priorities around. With the older generation voting twice as much as the youngest generation, they have more weight in our politics and therefore climate change remains almost last on the list of urgent issues in need of resolving. Politics are of central importance in this matter, and if we can get out and vote and get our friends voting, our generation can put educated people in office that support policies that work against climate change. We have the power to ensure a good future for ourselves and our children. People in office and who hold CEO positions tend to be above the age of 60 and will be gone before the climate crisis becomes a defining issue. We cannot afford anymore delay, we need to start voting for policies in support of the cause and directly educating our parents and grandparents so that they become aware of the risks as well. This personal approach is a great idea and I think it will be an effective way to keep everyone informed.

For various reasons, young people know more about the dangers of climate change than older people. Maybe people couldn't intuitively feel climate change before. Maybe entrepreneurs just want to make money without considering any consequences. Maybe politicians think that there are many things more important than the earth where people live. Whatever the reason, the people of our time will be responsible for protecting the environment. As we said in the video, now that we cannot change the minds of those in power, we should strive to become people in power, or let more people around us recognize the impact of climate change from now on. All in all, there is a lot we can do, we can use less plastic bags or drive less. But it is important that we need to take action and not just complain.

To be truly honest, I have always believed in climate change and the climate crisis but I never thought it was something I could change. I have always had an idea that someone else will fight that battle or that it isn't necessarily a pressing issue for me at the moment. However, how that I am educating myself more on the climate crisis it is something that needs to be changed and I have to do something about it. Now I think about my future and the future of the children I may have one day and how different the world will continue to be if nothing is done. I am looking forward to learning about ways that I can make a difference. At the same time, I really liked the approach Ken brought up about educating our parents. It is important to educate those around us so we don't feel like we are fighting this battle alone. Even with only educating, we can make a change because it will make others acknowledge their actions and be more aware of what they can also do to help. I agree with Ken that we can't wait around and we need to act now, I just don't know where to begin.

As soon as Professor Hiltner said "creating a new world," I paused the video and started thinking. This is one of the most exciting things I have heard in this class so far. So much evidence demands we make major changes or face our own extinction. This is terrifying for obvious reasons, but seeing that there is a necessity to fundamentally change how we move, live, and eat forces us to ask "what kinds of changes?" We could build new dense cities that call less for commuting over long distances and rely on public transportation and have good group conscientiousness of our impact on the environment.

After seeing both lectures. I began to think about what you said and how my generation has to step up. I strongly agree with that statement but unfortunately I feel like my many people in my generation are not fully convinced that the climate crisis is real. I know that with time things will get better, but I just don't know if there is enough time. I like to believe that a positive change will happen but I just feel like we need to all do this together. I think it will be impossible to convince others and they won't want a change until the destruction is right infant of their eyes. Although I mentioned that we don't have lots of time, I think that a good idea is to target the younger generation like your generation is doing to us. I believe that if we keep targeting the younger educational system more, these younger children will grow up thinking about this issue and possibly coming up with new solutions. I know we can't depend on others but I think we should still try this. I still believe we should do everything we can right now to fix this issue.

I agree with Professor Ken when he stated that our generation should not wait for the older generation to take charge of the climate crisis. I believe that instead of pointing fingers at each other for who is at fault, we should be bringing awareness to others and educating the older generation about the effects of climate change. Since the majority of those in power are the people who are in denial of the climate crisis, we need to vote for people who support a greener Earth. Our generation must outvote the older generation if we want our concerns to be heard especially since the world is soon going to be passed down to us. Although it may seem overwhelming, it is now our responsibility to try and save the planet and the future of many generations to come. As Professor Ken suggested, we can start by convincing those around us, such as parents, family members, and friends, to start voting for the people who truly care for our planet. The simple act of voting will bring us a step closer to saving the Earth.

even though I agree with most things that ken says, its difficult to see a future (or even within the "next few months" as he said) where everyone comes together to work towards combating climate change. and frankly, I don't think enough people are educated, or care enough, about climate change. it would make sense that anyone who has the information that we do would want to do whatever they can to fight against climate change, right? the only problem is, we have about 800 people in this course. comparing that number to the 7 billion people on earth is almost pointless. that's another reason I think combating climate change is too hard. not everyone cares or believes in it.  and there's no way that even 1 BILLION ( a number that seems unfathomable to me) but is merely eight of the total population can make that big of an impact of reversing climate change. and honestly, maybe that statement is naive and I don't know enough about what can really make a difference, but I guess that's something ill have to find out in the future.

Something that leaves me very pessimistic about this crisis is how much action is needed in such little time. It seems impossible for this to even happen, given how far behind we are right now. We have politicians that deny climate change and vote against measures to alleviate the crisis because they are being paid to. And there are many horribly misinformed (to nicely put it) people who deny climate change despite all evidence pointing against such a conclusion. How can we fix the crisis in the face of all of this? And while I do believe voting is important and can definitely help and that we should increase our generation's voter turnout to the max, there is only so much voting will do. Voting within a very rigged system that is typically not open to radical changes won't really stop billionaires from over consuming and over polluting, transnational corporations from privatizing public resources around the world, the use of environmentally hazardous chemical weapons in war zones, etc. all of which are non-environmentally sound practices that the ordinary person does not have the scope to change because they are practices of wealthy, powerful people and governments. Also, like Ken mentioned, the American capitalist value that happiness and success is to be found in money and material things has pervaded the rest of the world and is one of the factors behind the climate crisis. How can you rid the whole world of such a dangerous and detrimental value in such short amount of time? It seems impossible. I realize this sounds like a very pessimistic and hopeless rant but I often find it hard to think about the climate issue truthfully without adopting such a negative perspective.



</p><hr>


<p>
I like the fact that Ken straight up says things for how they are. In lecture he continued to talk about how things will not stay negative and I had doubts because so much damage has already been done but he’s restored my faith. The climate crisis is not nor should it be portrayed as a political issue. It is proven in science and even just in every day life that their are negative repercussions to our actions but Ken shows how my generation as well as the ones following can make a change for the better. We have the power to make real progress and we need to learn how we can do that even if it starts within just our family.

Like most of the comments posted in this video, Professor Ken Hiltner has earned my respect. I really appreciate what he has done and what he is currently doing for the sake of humanity. In light of what my generation can do to save the planet, It was really vague to suggest that we need to take control of the planet. It is definitely easy to say it but would require extreme actions to make it happen. With that being said, Action is what we as society need to do. I believe its time for us to stop pondering, contemplating, and constructing the “creative idea”, but rather just start doing something. In putting to practice, the whole idea of explaining and educating our parents or rather, the older generation, would definitely be ideal, that way, we could persuade them to start focusing on the climate change issue. After all, they are in control of the voting participation in politics that could influence and impact legislation which will lead to the solution of climate change. However, I believe the only downfall of this idea is that not all older generations would listen to us because we lack experience and that in some cases, they see us as children who have not done or achieved anything yet. Regardless, I believe either way, we as a newer generation should still persuade the idea that we should still try to educate them about climate change but at the same time, we should not rely to the belief that they will actually listen to us and do something about it. 
    <br><br>


In light of doing something about it, I agree with Professor Hiltner’s idea of reinventing the western culture when it comes to consumer demands. Conversely, I feel really guilty that I am contributing to the consumer demands, in which I buy things that heavily contribute to the carbon emission of our Planet. This idea would probably be the hardest shift of humanity as consumers massively rely on products or services that are responsible for climate change. I believe if we could slowly shift our consumer demands to eco-friendly alternatives, we would solve a huge chunk of climate change. I believe that the future leaders, innovators, engineers, artists, activists and etc are in the process of developing a market that would utilize eco-friendly resources. For instance, Elon Musk, known for his eco-friendly company that makes electric consumer cars and solar panels, proclaims that if we build 100 Tesla gigafactories, we would be able to solve climate change. However, the only thing that is holding humanity is the financial needs to do it and at the same time, the legislation to allow it.

<p>
Both in the lecture and in the video, it has been emphasized more than once that three-quarters of carbon dioxide is produced in planet’s atmosphere by more developed countries, while less developed countries suffer the most. The generation that cause the climate change think there is no huge consequence from burning fossil fuels. I don't think the last generation of ordinary people denied that they had caused the change in the environment, but some politicians who felt that they had been touched by the interests of the people were strongly in denial. For what we should do to take control of this planet, Professor Ken mentions that we can trade car for an e-bike. I think that's a little unrealistic. Bicycles can only travel small distances for most people. Cars are also important means of transportation over long distances.  But there is already a good trend: more and more people are opting for electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

I think the worst thing a parent or person in power can do for a child is not raise them with awareness. I was lucky enough to be raised to be "woke" with intelligent and hippie parents so I was never kept in the dark about the repercussions of my actions. And yet I feel discouraged because I feel like I have neglected my responsibilities as a human to preserve our Earth to the best of my abilities. I cannot thank Ken enough for motivating us to be better and help us. I am optimistic and scared and outraged and passionate; quite the cocktail of emotions and responses. With every article I become more and more passionate and aware of what I can do.




</p><hr>


<p>
As Ken points out climate change is has shown to be a generational video, which is understandable but also disappointing as those in political power are of this older generation. In order to make change in a democracy like ours we must vote people who are just as concerned about the environment. It is up to developed nations like ours to act upon this issue. An idea I appreciated is the fact that it is up to the younger generation to incorporate interpolation learning by teaching and educating their parents and family.
    <br><br>

As most are aware of the small deeds that can be done to be more environmentally conscious such as riding your bike, eating plant based, thrifting and more profound concept that Ken presented that I find to be true, is that we need to make a cultural change. The fundamental change in our western society values. We need to change our materialistic lifestyles and value things that do not have a price. We must adopt better habits that do not harm the earth and instead work on bettering our relationship with the earth by becoming more sustainable. This, instead of living off disposable products we must switch to reusables in order to ensure that generations after ours have a habitable earth.

<p>
I entirely agree with Professor Hiltner's suggestion that our generation must take power now. Older generations are ignorant to the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, reversing the appalling pollution they have done to our planet. Unless we take power, there will never be effective action against climate change and we will succumb to humanity's self-inflicted fate. I was ignorant myself that so many people did not vote, especially my generation, but I guess it is our fault for trusting older generations to face challenges they are ignorant of or deny. I appreciate the optimistic outlook towards facing climate change, and I am confident that if enough of us rise up to face humanity's greatest challenge we can conquer it. I am going to strive through my lifetime to educate as many people as I can of the impending disasters climate change has created for us, including my parents, and do whatever I can to battle climate change myself. I hope that world culture can become less consumeristic but it will be a long battle to change the gross LA influence of have as much as you can. I can not wait to see the newer world.

<p>
I agree that one of the reasons make the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting is their age, as, honestly, there was not much education on climate crisis at that time. In addition, those who in power make regulations based on interests of their own parties. Therefore, if we, the young generation, take the leading role of speaking out our goal of reducing carbon emission, the leading party then will act towards it. 
    <br><br>
According to data, Europe, China and the US, one-third of the population, are producing seven-eighths of the total carbon emission. And that means the rest of population and their offspring will suffer the most from what we produce. This looks like abuse to me at least. 
    <br><br>
For all of the human beings, solutions for the current situation must be proposed as the consequences are happening here and it is happening now. In the lecture video, Professor Hiltner suggested to vote. This is really an effective solution as it directly affects the regulations to manage the carbon release.

After watching the video, “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis.” Professor Ken mainly talks about why we are do not take action to protect the environment, and what my generation can do to take control of this planet. Because climate change is arguably a generational issue. Many people ignoring this problem because they are no one believes it. 
    <br><br>


I am excited that my generation needs to take control of this planet or at least set our sights on that goal and we need to start now today. This situation is urgent now. I think the climate education is necessary in the whole world, we need to make more young generation know that the earth is in danger. The fire, the drought, and other catastrophe was happened because of climate change. 
    <br><br>


In order to help moderate the climate crisis, we need to fundamentally reinvent Western culture, especially consumer culture and the belief that happiness is to be found in the things that we have. The small action, like taking the bus or railway, can also help the climate. If more people are willing to take action, even this small action can have a huge impact. As a young generation, we appreciate the modern world that the last generation build for us, but we also need to take the responsibility to solve the climate crisis left from the last generation.




</p><hr>


<p>
If Ken says that our generation can do it, best belief we will. We have all the power in our hands to make a change but we must do it now. I am taking this class with a lot of my friends and we were talking about how we should become vegans by doing so we would be doing a lot more than we thinking towards controlling climate change. Controlling what we eat will help out a lot because slowly this generation will begin to consume less diary and meat. At the beginning of this quarter I told my mom how this planet is dying and us humans are the only ones responsible for this. She was shocked when I told her everything that will happen by 2050 if we do not do anything about it. It feels like it is a nightmare or a scary movie when I am hearing about climate change but it is in fact reality. This child to parent method is very effective because I am sure that after telling my mom about climate change she has  probably spread the news to her friends over the phone.
    <br><br>
This year it is time for my generation to vote and let our voices be heard. We are the ones that have the most power in change but yet do absolutely nothing to make that happen. If we fight for a government that believes in climate change and in action to prevent it from becoming more severe then change will begin to occur. Right now we have a government that does not believe in climate change we can not let them continue letting them rule this country. It is obvious that climate change exists and actions need to be done right now. It will take years until our government begins to apologize to everyone about them not doing anything towards helping control climate change.

The transfer of power from boomers to the younger generation seems to have already begun, which is very exciting. In the past few years, we've witnessed Ocasio Cortez and Greta Thunberg rise to fame. Two people who have gained an audience of millions of other young people through a shared iron will to make a positive change, regardless of what all the oldies have to say about it. Also, neither of them have acquired their powerful positions through undermining democracy, which is what gave us our problems in the first place. They seem to truly be representing the people. 
    <br><br>
We say that climate change isn't a political issue. It isn't. It's a state of emergency. However, if you're expecting politicians to hear that and drop everything to help, you have far too much faith in our politicians. In order to fix this, we are going to have to play the politics game, and win it. The next presidential election will likely be the most important in our history, and will have the largest percentage of youth voters ever. Whoever is put in the oval office, regardless of party, will be one of the most instrumental figures to confront this crisis as we near the final years to act. It all depends on what they want their legacy to be.

We as humans, especially in developed countries, have designed a way of life that is completely incompatible with our earth. With industrialization and our car culture releasing a terrifying amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and our meat industries polluting with methane, we are doomed. What’s even more frightening is that we, as a younger generation, are aware of the risks of the climate crisis and we recognize its urgency, but we still only know this one way of life. We are put in this position where we need to somehow fix the damage done and prevent it in the future by completely revolutionizing the way we live our lives such as doing things Ken mentioned in the video like shifting away from consumer culture. 

    <br><br>

There are many ways to individually contribute like driving a more eco friendly vehicle, or refusing to eat meat. These individual choices are important and noble, but this is a crisis that warrants immediate, large-scale change. The only way to achieve the type of change on a large enough scale to actually save us from ourselves is through legislation. Ken brings up a great point that a large step in making change is through voting because we need to make sure that the younger more passionate and informed groups have a voice that is heard. Another important step would be to vote for people who put the climate crisis as a main issue of theirs. Cortez’s Green New Deal, mentioned by Ken in this video, for example is the type of radical change that is necessary if we want to have even a chance of long-term success in navigating this crisis. The climate crisis is not going to wait for us to catch up, we need radical change and we need it now.

It seems that "taking control of the destiny of the earth" within the next few years is quite a lot of pressure to put on a group of people preoccupied with trying to pass chemistry. Change the world or else our children, their children, and all of life on earth will feel the devastating consequences for the foreseeable future. But don't get TOO alarmed. I think the terrifying reason my generation feels frustrated that our mentors will not give us a straight answer on how to fix this crisis boils down to the fact that nobody really has a clue where to begin. If it were simple, this crisis would have been solved decades ago.
    <br><br>
Not to say that there aren't places to start on a personal level; eat plant-based, vote for environmentally conscious law makers, take public transportation. But how do we start to change the deeply ingrained system of the use of fossil fuels in our country, especially when the system we are inheriting is bought-off and corrupt to the highest levels of power in our country? These questions obviously do not have a neatly defined answer. Overthrow the government, maybe? After your chemistry quiz, of course.

I love your sarcasm, and also that all of your sentences are coherent, so I wanted to respond. 

    <br><br>

I feel like you raise the issue of systemic vs. personal change in an interesting way. Ken is advocating for an approach he self-describes as radical - one that honestly could sound more evocative of a teen apocalypse drama than a genuine and actionable plan, if it weren't starting to happen in some places. Overthrowing the government is obviously hyperbolic, and I think it might have been smart for Ken to specifically note that he wasn't advocating for violence (not a given lately?), but it does feel unattainable to imagine collective uprising significant enough to shift the fossil fuel monolith that doesn't involve violence, or just a long, long time. Madison Watkins (pinned comment) talked about how effective speaking to their parents was in making their house more environmentally friendly, but I can't convince mine that climate change is, y'know, real.
    <br><br>


 It's hard to imagine a political movement centered on this generation affecting the necessary change when someone from anything resembling my generation won't run for president for another three terms (and probably won't have a chance for five, if history is anything to go off of). 

    <br><br>

Buttigieg's youth is pigeon-holing him as radical and inexperienced, despite having incredibly moderate politics on the whole, and I'll have to live my lifetime over to reach his age. The damage to the planet in those 20 years will be devastating. 
    <br><br>


I feel a little bit like Dumbledore has given me a magic hoodie and a list of death souls to hunt... There needs to be intervention by the people in power, now. I won't stop doing everything I can, but I agree that there needs to be action and some level of guidance from people in charge now, and I think Ken is leading towards this idea when he talks about voting, and speaking to family.

I think it’s very interesting how we can actually see that individuals of Ken’s generation have caused this initial climate crisis and are the ones mostly in denial of how humans hurt this Earth. I can even say I know older people and generations that do believe climate change is about politics and people are corrupt regarding this topic and use it as political leverage. I find the poll of who cares about the climate crisis generationally very interesting because I almost knew that or could feel that already. The powers of the world are generally older than everyone in my generation, and feel that we should have more of a voice on higher power scales. I understand this is difficult to do but, the idea brought up about taking over the world resonates deep within me and has for a while now. We as young adults are the new wave of humans who will be running this world with each and every one of our decisions. I love how you also encourage our generation to vote because this is very important and if any generation doesn’t understand this, it’s for sure mine.

As the generation who will deal with most of the consequences of the climate change we are in charge of enacting change and educating the older generation. Without the support of the older generations, I do not think much will change, The older generations have most of the power in the government, and many of them do not see climate change I a huge issue. Many of them will die before devastating changes take place, so they either need to be educated on the seriousness of the issue or be replaced by a younger person.

I appreciate this video more than the rest. When a ton of information is thrown at me, and likely a lot of others, it'd hard to know exactly what to do with that information. You read articles and you begin to understand how devastating climate change is, but that's it. Just understanding. And with that understanding comes just an extreme sense of hopelessness and anxiety and no clue how I, a 21 year old student with an ever dwindling GPA and an even more depressing bank account, can make any sort of difference in helping turn around climate change. It's worth a fight to try and save the earth at the very least. Then our generation will be remembered with dignity, if anyone's around to remember us.

Upon further analysis of your comment I can also relate to the feeling of hopelessness. In a world where the majority of pollution is due to major corporations it almost seems like the system has been created to shut our efforts down time and time again. Growing up I heard that I should make a conscious effort to recycle and reduce my waste, but no one taught us how to make legislative change. However, if we find a way to mobilize the youth ( you and I included) to veer against the age of consumerism and toward the future of sustainability, there me be hope. The video shows that the most important part about this whole issue is conversation between generations.

The video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” had a point about the amount of power that the older generation hold and the difference in values they envision the future should have. It is a surprise to me that the average age of senators in the congress is 60 years old and the number gets to 70 in the supreme court. This proves that our legal system is still perhaps built upon a set of values from the previous generations, and this could be the cause of stagnation in the process of climate change policy making. I agree with the video that voting is a good way to indirectly carry out actions that benefit efforts of combating climate change because politicians essentially promise what we want for a good poll result. For example, majority of the 2020 presidential candidates have proposed policies as a response to the recent uprising of environmental activism due to Greta Thunberg. To name a few, Sanders aligns himself with The Green New Deal that focus on creating an industry of renewable energy. Yang promises the implementation of geoengineering techniques as technological solutions to the climate crisis. Biden will push for electric vehicles and charging stations across the country. At the moment I think our voices do matter and the politicians have to listen, therefore it is important, as said in the video, to also transfer our beliefs and knowledge to our parents so all of us can make a difference by voting.

This video is empowering. People, including myself, often want to help prevent further climate change but do not know how to go about it. However, this video breaks it down in steps that are tangible enough to be taken by the average person. I am cognizant of the fact that older generations are the primary creators of the climate crisis but that in no way absolves my generation from responsibility. The planet's fate rests in our hands and it is important that we take necessary action. I firmly agree that political involvement is one of the most important steps that we can take to begin to mitigate climate change. It does indeed begin with increasing our voter turnout; most people who understand the reality of the climate crisis are in the least engaged age constituency. I like the idea of not only voting ourselves but encouraging five of our friends to turn out as well. It is unfair that my generation is left to deal with the horrific consequences of the older generations but there is no time to dwell on that injustice. We have to cooperate with those who remain in a state of denial and expose them to the immediate reality of climate change. For example, today I had lunch with my grandparents. I typically avoid potentially controversial subjects with them because I know that my worldview is inherently different from that of people who are almost 80. However, when they asked about my classes, I explained to them how enlightened yet terrified I feel by my climate crisis class. I explained that I am learning a ton about how to decrease my footprint and treat the planet better but I also mentioned that our environment really is in shambles and the future will remain bleak unless my generation makes sweeping change. They were initially shocked by some of the facts I told them and I understood and forgave their skepticism because of their age. I continued and explained that the area they live(not far from Ventura) is one of the most affected locations in the country by the climate crisis. It was crazy to me that they had no idea about this but I understand it. Although I may not have gotten through to them, I am glad I tried and will continue to do so. It is their generation with the most voting power so I hope to incentivize them to care about the climate crisis. This video succinctly explains the real problem at hand; those in power have lived most of their lives without feeling the effects of climate change so they see little reason to prevent it. This complex is the main cause of the issue because this leads to government policies that support corporate profit at the expense of our planet's wellbeing. I feel empowered to do my best to help older generations realize the effects of climate change and possibly change the way they vote. I also feel inspired to research policy and vote for the first time in the next elections. I am going to share videos like this with my family and encourage them to understand the gravity of the current situations. Worst case scenario: they disagree and I waste a few minutes of my time. More likely though, they hear me out and change the way the view the world and vote accordingly. I feel a lot more optimistic knowing the value of my attempts to educate those around me, especially older people who are not frequently confronted by the honest reality.

After watching the videos it is apparent that the child to parent mitigation technique will be key to informing our past generations that haven't had the proper education in the climate crisis. By having all content available to the public I believe this course alone will contribute to the exposure of climate change to Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers. I believe that improving voter turnout is only half of the problem while the other half comes from having informed voters. 
    <br><br>
In order for actual change to happen, it is very evident that our government needs young blood to shift our focuses. While older politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Al Gore seek to inform the country of the dangers of the climate crisis. 
    <br><br>
Overall I do not like the idea that it is our problem to face. With observations of a true crisis at hand; the fact of the matter is that there is no excuse for lack of action.

Taking control of this planet seems overwhelmingly. How can we, as students, change the world? It always seem as though there are fewer of us than there are of them. Professor Hiltner says that we cannot wait for the normal course of life to help, that we must take charge of our future. How can we do that, though? We watch, alarmed, as fires burn through our state, as our own cliffs in Isla Vista fall, and it seems to be helpless. I grew up believing that those adults around me would be able to help – now, as a college student, I watch as those same adults fall prey to fake news, to believing that climate change isn’t actually real. It’s horrific, and I honestly worry for my future and the future of the generations after me.



</p><hr>


<p>

I feel so sad when heard that some other less urgent issues are ranked ahead of climate crisis. The fact is that many old people, generally those aged above 40, ignore the effect of climate crisis, and some other people, especially those who are lack of vision or undereducated, tend to care more about things surround them. The delayed effect of crisis is very disarming for most people. To address this issue, I think the popularization of climate education is necessary since people don’t believe it because they don’t understand it. For the solution provide by Ken, I can feel the urgency of this problem. However, the first solution, which is vote, surprised me. Probably because I’m not from a democratic country like US, I don’t know how vote can change the decision-making process. For me, I really agree with the idea that we should communicate more with our parents. My parents are used to live a life with high carbon emission. But I always use what I learned from ES classes to educate them. Now, they almost consume no beef at all. And the first choice for transportation is railway or bus. It’s relatively easy for them to change their life style since they are not addicted to consumer economy.

<p>

Up until this point in the course, I have felt helpless. After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” and the material following it, I have felt a sense of helplessness. I have heard you (Ken) say multiple times at how you will tell us ways to take action on the current climate crisis and I believe the lecture “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” is the beginning. 
    <br><br>

I was surprised to not feel anxious and helpless anymore. Maybe it’s because I have heard you (Ken) talk about what’s happening multiple times now. While part of me wants to be mad that my generation and the next are left responsible to take action on the climate crisis, I've come to terms that complaining won’t get anything done. Commenting on the suggestion of taking a “personal approach” to the climate crisis, I believe that this is a great first step for those who have not had experience. I will personally be doing this with my mother and family.

<p>
I appreciate this video for emphasizing the power of today’s generation in acting upon the climate crisis. It really made me think about ways that we can all work collectively to do something about the crisis. I truly believe that we have the power to change the direction that the planet is taking. This video reminded me of Greta Thunberg, of our own generation who started a movement to skip school and protest. Her contribution to the climate movement continues to inspire people from all over the world. As addressed in this video, during the protests in the 1960s and 70s, the younger people have changed the world politically and culturally, raising awareness for issues they truly care about. Thus, through these examples of change and today’s movements, there can be hope to work together to save the planet. 
    <br><br>

Even changes to our lifestyle, educating the public about the climate crisis, and voting can lead toward change. However, from thinking this through I also thought about the challenges within our own generation. These challenges can be from apathy about the climate crisis, to being misinformed, or people not wanting to change their consumer lifestyle. Yes, it can be understood that some people won’t be willing or able to change their diets or their habits of shopping, but I still believe in the possibility of changing the world.

This lecture video was nice because among the countless number of problems and issues that we face due to climate change, there is finally an offering of a solution. Although it is disappointing that there is so little we can actually do as the younger generation, hearing what we can do gives me hope that we might actually be able to fight this problem and  save our futures. One of the most important things we can do is vote and I am so happy Ken used his platform to remind us of how powerful it is. It's sad to still hear that we have a very low voter turnout compared to other generations, but I believe with enough determination we can change that and make our voices heard. As far as teaching our older family members about climate change and how important it is to acknowledge, I think that that is a very interesting solution that I hadn't thought of before. It's definitely an issue I am going to going up during Thanksgiving dinner and I have all my family members trapped in one space. But in all seriousness, I hope that we all take doing this into consideration and give our older relatives a crash course on climate change and get them to understand how urgent it is.

<p>
Most people over the age of 40 are unable to see the effects of climate change as an important issue, as the impacts are often delayed. So, it basically comes down to our younger generations to take charge and shift our society to a greener future. But this seems like an impossible task, as the average age of an individual in our government is over the age of 60. I do believe in Ken when he states that the best course of action for us is to vote in order to pass more initiatives that help our cause and also elect leaders that understand the urgency in solving this climate crisis. 

    <br><br>

What I am skeptical about is Ken's answer to undoing what his generation has already done. He states that the answer is to reinvent Western culture or consumer culture. This is an impossible job and our society is too far past the point of reinventing our culture. This to me does not seem like the best course of action as it is more likely that you can convince a climate denier that climate change is real rather than trying to shift the culture our nation was built on.

I thought this video was extremely necessary. I feel as though many people, including myself, find themselves wanting to help make a difference, but don't really know where to start. I hear a lot about having to act in terms of politics and changing systems that have been in place for so many years, and those tasks seems really daunting and on such a large scale. And while these are so so important to tackle, it can make people feel like they aren't doing anything towards the problem. That's why I think small-scale actions, like voting, altering your diet and activism are very important, because it allows people to feel like what they are doing can make a difference, and gives more motivation to keep going.
    <br><br>

One solution I feel isn't discussed as much as it should be is child to parent intergenerational education. I feel like our generation hears a lot about having to educate the youth and each other, but I never considered children educating older generations like their parents. I found this particularly interesting because it was something I have been doing for a year now without even realising it. I have had open conversations with my parents and our diet in terms of cooking meat (particularly red meat) in our home. Over the past year, we have tried to reduce this as much as possible, and I think it is a great starting point to working up to a more vegetarian/vegan lifestyle. It can be quite daunting to have such conversation with the older generation, especially with parents because it's always a bit uncomfortable when discussing issues that they don't necessarily agree with. But, you never know what can come out of a small open and honest conversation.




</p><hr>


<p>

It bothers me a lot to see the gap that we have created between the generations due to constant blaming and pointing fingers at each other. We are already past that point. What we have to do now is unite in the common goal of helping the planet, the animals, and, most importantly, ourselves, to avoid being on the edge of collapse. 
    <br><br>

I agree with Ken that we have to act now -- we can't delay a problem of such importance that can bring so much devastation into people's lives. 
    <br><br>
One of the ways we can help our planet is by using energy wisely. Most of us do not need as much energy as we use on a regular basis, so turning the light off in one room while being in the other would be a wise decision. Not only would you be helping fight climate change, but also helping yourself by saving money (that you can further spend on solar panels or another alternative for fossil fuel energy and pay even less!). These kinds of solutions, I think, is what people need right now: something that is beneficial to both sides. So many people are refusing to give up eating meat because there is just no better alternative for it. And this is just a simple example. Our way of life (use of electricity, consumption and production of food, etc.) is like our habit of eating meat - it's hard to change when there is no better alternative.

<p>
What struck me the most when watching these lectures was Ken urging us to “act now” and to “take control of the world”.  It’s hard to grasp how screwed we already are especially when Ken said we don't even have years to act. I believe anyone who hears this information will actively vote and try to take control. As he stated our current government is being run by the older generation and the majority of voters are people of the older generation. I think the older generations ignore the climate crisis because they are more worried about their money or things they believe will affect them or their money. I believe it's just the way they lived a majority of their lives. The climate crisis wasn’t a crisis when they were coming up so they just ignored the facts that what they were doing was harmful to the environment. But now as they reach the end of their lives they know that dont have to live through the crisis which will plague our generation for decades. 
    <br><br>

I think another problem our generation has is the mentality that making a lifestyle choice won’t be enough to make a difference. They feel as if they’re acting alone. But I feel that people who make these decisions should stay consistent and the effects will just snowball. Of course, don’t try to force the people around you to adapt to your lifestyle but just educate them on the decision you made and just hope they decide to change even if it’s in a slight way.

I agree with you that it is quite alarming that Ken repeats that we don't have time to spare. The damage has already be done and will only continue at exponential rates if we don't step up and make changes. I found it ironic how it is stressed that the previous generation is to blame for the deteriorating condition of the planet but are the ones to continue to support political groups that fail to take action. Do they not realize that they are only exasperating the problem by making it harder for our actions to make a difference? Ken made a good point that I hadn't thought of which was how if even we wanted to start becoming more eco-friendly such as using a bike instead of a car, the power of politicians who support the oil and road infrastructure industries will make it harder to use the bike, diminishing any sort of progress that would've been made. For this reason, the first and foremost thing we can all do is vote and encourage our peers to do so. Being outnumbered 2 to 1 by the people who caused this to happen and are continuing it is angering and frustrating. After learning about this, I will go register to vote as that in itself is the first step to making a difference.

All the history courses I’ve taken since I started school taught that the past one hundred years have been the period of the most rapid development of technology in human history and also the most polluting period of all time. As a new generation, we appreciate the more convenient life that the last generation reached for us but also are shouldering the task to solve these climate crisis left behind by all this good life. Professor Hiltner stated that not all people from the last generation, which holds most the power, fully realized the severity of the situation, and the best solution to mitigate the climate crisis is for the young to try to take control of this planet as soon as possible. 
    <br><br>

One way mentioned in the video to help the young taking control is to vote, but when I think about what could I do as an international student since mitigating the global warming is not only a national mission but also a world mission, many ideas came to my mind. Nowadays, all kinds of social media created a great deal of internet celebrities, and they are often invested to promote commodities or share their lifestyles. If the idea of mitigating global warming could be shared by them, more people would realize the situation and probably take actions. Young people among then reach to their parents as explained in the video; the obstacles will be greatly reduced. I think this is also why “Before the Flood” picked Leonardo DiCaprio to act, instead of a person with expertise. Celebrity power can sometimes have a huge impact.

I agree with you that some educational publications on global climate change could be helpful in terms of educating generations. Ken mentioned the child-to-parent education is something that really needs to be promoted. The problem is not that our generation does not act but instead the problem falls on to the last generation who actually caused the catastrophe. My parents and the relatives of their age are widely "ignorant" of the climate crisis. In part, their education did not cover such issues as much as ours do. But for the most part, it is their lack of responses that intensified the situation-- they stick onto the luxurious lifestyle that has hold for decades. And since the knowledge about global warming is nearly inaccessible to them, their inactiveness sometimes counter-react with our generation's mindset. And even if they are "forced" to participate in our generations' saving-the-climate activities, they sincerely don't care about the problem that much. So to conclude, the most essential step to take is to educate every generation about the climate crisis--not only us but also the generations that should take the responsibility.

First off, I was caught off guard when I heard about Elon Musk's plans to create a habitable environment on Mars. While that does sound like a crazy (but good) idea that would solve all of our problems I can't help but to think about how the human race would just end up creating the same problems all over again, just with a clean slate- almost like if we hit a reset button. I think people should start realizing how bad our planet is right now and begin taking action now. 
    <br><br>

Although I believe there's going to be a lot of people from my generation who are going to be voting at the next election, I become frustrated with those who take voting as a joke and decide to avoid it. If more of us went out to vote, we would for sure be able to surpass the percentage of voters aged 65 and over. Voting is honestly one of our only hopes towards a better world and my generation needs to take it more seriously. Those who are 65 or older were more likely to consider climate change as a minor problem. When I heard that they ranked the issue at 23/29, I was shocked. How can someone really not believe global warming isn’t occurring all around us given all the new issues that arise every single day? Even though the news and other media show us how different parts of the world are being affected daily, they sometimes don't give any coverage whatsoever to those in underdeveloped countries. I can only pray and hope that people go out to vote for the right cause.

I am very proud to be a part of the generation that is fighting against climate change with great ferocity and action. Ken mentioned a solution that involved communicating with parents about climate change and I think that this can be very helpful! Although I personally have very stubborn parents, I think it's important to educate my parents about climate change and what it means for future generations, so I continue to try to drop tips every now and then when it comes up. I'd like to believe that the old generation do care, but they are just so stuck in their old ways and habits. Communication between generations is important, without it, there will be further misunderstandings and grudges being held. Communication could be the key to getting the older generations to acknowledge the damage they've created and start supporting climate activism. They are human and love the planet just as much as we do, they've lived longer than us and have memories they cherish that were created on Earth; they just need to realize the reality of climate change. It is also important because the elderly make up the majority of the voting population and having them on our side, the side of environmental justice, would be a major step for the stopping the climate crisis.

    <br><br>



On the mention of voting, a majority of youth feel that their votes don't matter, which accounts for the lack of youth voter turnout. But voting is so important if we want to see change. We need to become the change that we want to see. Supporting political candidates who share similar sentiments to create a more balanced government with representatives that align with our identities, like younger candidates, instead of allowing the older generation to have total dominance of the government. The youth demand to be heard, and voting is the first step.

After watching “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” and “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis”, I wonder why the older generation makes the rules for the future generation and the future they are not going to live in. I feel like people who are old, like  70 or even 75 should not be able to vote. Not because they do not deserve rights, but because they might not make it for another 5 years, since the life expectancy in the US  in 2016 was 78.69 years according to the World Bank. With that being said we need more younger voters, our generation is the generation to help control Earth. This is our future and I do not want the older generation to make the rules. They are the ones who put 3 quarters of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere, you think that is okay. We are the ones who need to fix that. We are cleaning up after them it is not fair. I have hope that we can but we need to get people who recognize the problem and attack. It sucks knowing that if we do not start now we are gonna have serious consequences. So let us start before it is too late.

Finally we hear some solutions to the climate change problem! It was very discouraging to keep constantly hearing about the issues and how people are being affected. I believe that our generation has a great opportunity here to go down in history as people who helped save the world. But I think we need a way to help everyone come together to fight for climate change. Some people within are generation are continuing in older generation’s footsteps in not making climate change a major priority. Many in our generation, I think it was about 2/3, still aren’t voting which is very troubling. It will take some effort to get at least the majority on board but I think it is possible 
    <br><br>

The thing I found most interesting about the video was the fact that many of those who have caused climate change are either in denial or in climate delay both of which are causing inaction. It is really depressing knowing this and the fact that still in the present these generations don’t think of climate as a priority although I think it makes sense. Many people in these older generations have lived most of their life already so they probably won’t even see most of the affects of climate chang

I had a difficult time watching this duo of lecture videos. In them Ken states that because the previous generation did not act to prevent further climate change, and in some cases denied climate change altogether, we have to act immediately to halt the disastrous effects by “taking over the planet”. This is a lot of pressure to give one generation. And while I agree that the problem needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY, I have a difficult time seeing it as a feasible goal for us to accomplish quickly. You say the only way we can “take control of the planet” is through voting and speaking to our parents. Both of these methods take time. In terms of voting, yes, we can put more people in office who want to take action on climate change but it is still extremely difficult to create laws and deals that help prevent climate change. Our system is slow working and there is a great deal of push back from powerful industries (such as the fossil fuel industry). Money plays an enormous part in our government and most of our generation cannot compete. So yes I do think we can effect some change in through voting but I think these effects will be slower than is necessary. In terms Talking to our parents and elders, I worry that this method is not necessarily effective enough to create a wave of change. I know this is not the case for everyone, but for me, the majority of individuals who I have tried to talk to about climate change (who do not believe in its existence) have been entrenched in their views and unwilling to concede any points. Perhaps we can convince those who are on the fence about climate change but I worry that it will not be enough. I want immediate change, I know we need immediate change, I just don’t know if we will be able to accomplish enough immediate change.

When the generation responsible is asked why they’re not acting on it you think there’s no good enough answer. After these two lecture videos, you become somewhat understanding. It’s easy to be in denial with the pace of the consequences of climate change and that’s why I understand where you’re coming from. I agree, it is a lot of pressure, but it has to be done. We aren’t left with many options and what Ken is suggesting will make a difference. You mention that there are many people that still deny the fact that climate change is real,  but that shouldn’t stop the rest of us from making change. Ignorance is bliss but it’s time to wake up and join the reality that time will heal the Earth. Ken suggests that we “take control”. If we begin to educate the uninformed, more people will get involved and the fight against climate change will become a ripple effect. Creating new relationships and connections will spread awareness around the globe and place more importance on this issue. The same way climate change doesn’t happen overnight, neither will solving it.

After watching Ken’s video I was really struck by the idea of intergenerational discourse between parent and child. While it seems obvious, that a child may confide to their parent, I feel like there’s a large boundary in the relationship between parent and child. Often times, children will feel a disconnect from their parents and rebel against them. This is not even considered rare, in fact, it’s really seen in teenagers of all types. As a child will begin to have influences that stray from the household where parents control opinions, on such occasions, the child will begin to have their own opinion and say in what they believe in and judgments tend to clash. Thus, to consider for a child to tell their parent what to do is perfectly optimistic however I feel like it is just not realistic. It seems to be a general rule in society that the older you get the more respectable your opinion becomes, yet after becoming more informed in the world’s view and more importantly, the different generational views’ on the climate crisis, I believe it is reasonable to say that the youth may be trusted a little more based simply on the actions of elder generations and their denial to the facts behind the climate crisis. Consequently, while I respect Ken very much as a person and as a professor, I simply believe that this is not something that will work.

I agree with what you are saying towards the relationship consequences between parent and child. A child only knows what’s best for it by what the parents teach then therefor if the parents are ignorant towards climate change so will the children and so far. But, if a parent decides to act upon this and integrate climate awareness values towards the child life this can make a huge impact because that kid can tell all his friends too and when that kid has kids they’ll grow up with same values.
</span></div><hr>


<p>
I really appreciate what Ken is doing for our planet and I could totally understand all of his suggestions for us to act. It was unfortunate that our parents and ancestors left us a messy environment, but it’s never too late for us to take actions that are environmentally friendly.
    <br><br>


Personally, I think doing things in daily life could also impact the big picture; drinking water with our own water bottles instead of purchasing plastic bottle water could, to some extent, mitigate the greenhouse effect on our earth since creating plastic requires a great amount of oil extraction, by which it releases greenhouse gases, and the decrease in the demand of plastic bottled water will cause the supply of it to decrease. However, this is just not enough. I like one of the concepts that Ken mentioned in his mini-lecture: Intergenerational Education. We are the generation receiving the newest information and knowledge, so we have the responsibility to inform them about the urgency of protecting our planet and elaborate it into details. It’s not only for our parents but for our children and descendants as well.
    <br><br>


In the aspect of ranking the executive ability, the people in power should have taken a lot more actions for saving our planet from the climate crisis, but some of them are still rejecting the fact that the climate crisis is real and doubting our situation. Under this circumstance, it’s not about politics and all we need is a change to save our planet.
    <br><br>


We are doing this not only because of the planet but also ourselves.

After watching both lecture videos by Ken, the video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” inspired me to take action. 
    <br><br>

One thing I have done in the past was set out to find ways I can support groups and programs here on campus. I came across CALPIRG, a student-directed and funded non-profit set out to protect the environment, end hunger and homelessness, protect consumers and make college more affordable. I signed up to support the organization by pledging $10 a quarter to help their research which will allow them to advocate full time in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. giving them a voice in Congress. Donating $10 a quarter will help those involved and seeking training in the program, to speak on behalf of all of us to make a difference. Last school year, the group campaigned for 100% renewable energy in California. 
    <br><br>

Renewable energy should be advocated for due to its positive impact on the environment. Methods of renewable energy which include solar and wind, provide little to no contribution to global warming emissions as opposed to non-renewable which contributes about 29% of emissions. This is significant in that non-renewable sources such as coal, are one of the largest contributors to air pollution causing health risks and are known to cause climate change. By making the switch to renewable energy, we would see a dramatic decrease in our carbon emissions and reduce the likelihood of humans possessing health-related issues such as heart problems or premature death. This issue is very important and I plan on spreading the word to other classmates and encouraging many to also take part in supporting the use of renewable energy.

Ken repeatedly says that his generation didn’t do their part,
and yet I argue that environment activists like Ken himself are one of the
evidence that they actually did their parts. Saying this doesn’t mean I am agreeing
on nothing is wrong about the current model of how our society functions, created
and controlled by most of the older generation.




    <br><br>

 In fact, it gives me
hope that with all our efforts, the seemingly impossible task can be finished
eventually, despite how urgent it is needed to be done. The goal is to “Take control
of this planet” and increase the political power of the new generation, which only
works if the urgency about slowing down climate change is spreading in our
generation. Spreading information is the first and most important step, the
rest can be automatically done if enough people realized how important it is. 



    <br><br>


We indeed play an important role as a joint connecting the older
generation to new information, putting climate change as alarming high
priority with increased political power. But people like Ken made the first
move of spreading, without this course I wouldn’t be conscious about what I
should or can do about climate change. Now all of us already became part of who
are willing to act and spread about climate changes, it means it’s not too late
for a brighter future for our or next generations.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching this lecture videos, there are two things Ken said that stood out the most to me, “You need to take control of the planet,” and “We( the older generation) will be dead and buried when you will be dealing with the worst of this.” 
    <br><br>

Like many of us, I have good faith in our generation to take action and responsibility, that includes myself. I also believe that, again, criticizing the older generations will not change the fact that we are about to face a possible sixth extinction on the planet, blaming each other simply will not make anything better. Plus, there are some from the older generation that continue to raise awareness and speak out for action about the issue of climate change, Al Gore and our professor would be great examples. 
    <br><br>

To summarize, there’s no one else that could make turn the switch other than ourselves. Even if our grandparents or parents realize how serious the consequences of climate change will be, there’s nothing they can do about it. We as the current generation that is going to face all the possible future, will have to take action and make the change. It is not just for us, but the future generations too.

Ken saying “You need to take control of the planet” struck me the most as well, it is our turn to take responsibility and help our only planet. What we do as of right now will definitely leave a chain of events that eventually change what our planet will be decades into the future. We at least have to act responsibly. (not to worsen the situation anymore) We also have to have faith in us, all it takes is one less car running on the road, one less burger being eaten, and one acre of forest spared by me, by you, by all of us. 
    <br><br>

To be honest, I used to be very pessimistic about our situation. But after seeing more and more people devoting their lives to the cause, I am beginning to think that we might still have a chance, and we must take it.
    <br><br>

Act now, before its too late.

We really do use the term “democracy” loosely in the U.S.A. It is meant to protect the “in-crowd” and harm the out-crowd as much as possible; this was true prior to abolitionism, prior to the civil rights movement, prior to the feminist movement. Currently, our nation’s democracy is being used as a tool to protect the interests of fossil fuel corporations while harming everyone else. Voting is incredibly important to start leveraging the system to help protect future generations from the rapidly approaching climate catastrophe. If we can change the demographics of Congress to instate officials who better represent our own interests and concerns, we can begin to make change on a nationwide (as well as international!) scale. I think that the idea that “individual votes don’t matter” is a tool used by the voting population to protect their own voting power and interests. I reject this idea: votes matter. As a reminder, the election is rapidly approaching.

One thing that I’m looking forward to learning more about  is the tool of child to parent intergenerational learning. As of today, I cannot imagine directly speaking to my parents about the climate crisis; as (generally) liberal and forward-thinking Gen X'ers, trying to change their mind about anything in conversation is...daunting, to say the least. They think that they are progressive, and that’s enough, when what this Earth really needs is a large group of nonviolent radical activists. The only thing that I feel I can do right now is lead by example and hope that they become more supportive and open-minded. One success I’ve had is living low-waste, even when I go home to visit over breaks. My mom appreciates how much cheaper it is to not buy single use items for cleaning, storage, etc., and has stopped buying plastic bags and paper towels in favor of reusable alternatives. While this is only a small success, and it may not even count as child to parent intergenerational learning, it makes me feel a little bit better knowing that I’ve influenced someone else to make an environmentally positive change.

I constantly hear from climate change activists that we need to “act now” - but it’s hard to know what that means. I loved that Ken offered some suggestions that were completely plausible for the average student: exercise your right to vote and educate others. I think it is a huge step forward to give suggestions on what people can do to help with the climate crisis without asking them to make drastic lifestyle changes that may seem frightening. 
     <br><br>
The previous midterm election showed us how big of an impact we can have just by voting - simply electing a congresswoman who cared so much about climate change allowed for the Green New Deal to be introduced. If we continue to vote, and continue to educate others, especially those older than us, so that they vote in support of climate change activism too, we may be able to successfully fight the crisis. Our generation has so much power, but it is imperative that we use it now because as every climate change documentary, article, or video has told us, we need to act now.

I agree with you that Ken was effective when communicating strategies to reduce our Carbon footprints without changing our lives too drastically. I would like to point out though that it is imperative that we don’t just focus on just making small changes and do what Ken said, drastically change western culture. Like you said we must act now, so by doing what we can to help our planet is much needed. I also agree with you that our generation has much power, but the fact that a third of us vote vs the older generation having two thirds of their population vote is scary. I feel like we are the generation most concerned about climate change because it is in our future, not theirs. This is why our voice is so important because if we don’t use it, we will continue to have people in positions of power that frankly don’t care about the climate crisis because it isn’t their problem to handle. It amazes me on how far the generational disconnect regarding this crisis is and how low of a priority it is older for older people, you would think they would have some more concern for the future generations. I have faith that we as a generation can make a stand and make sure we are heard and affect politics by voting for those who make climate change their number one priority, my only concern is how long it will take. Can we increase the votes from our young adults, can we cause small change, can we start to change western culture, can we enough difference in the short amount of time we have left before all hell breaks loose and our planet suffers? I just fear that the damage is already done and there isn’t enough time for our generation to make our last stand. With that said, we won’t go down without trying to make changes in our lives and preach to others to do the same. I am interested going forward about what we can do to handle and eventually subdue this problem.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. I also like how Ken expressed ways our voices could be effectively heard by suggesting voting. I believe voting can make a huge impact in helping one be part of the change. There is only so much we can do ourselves, as not everyone has direct power in changing laws, but there are ways we can help, such as voting. If majority of youth and other environmental activists choose to vote, we can end up playing a huge role in stopping this issue. I agree with you that we should choose to act NOW before it ends up being too little too late. We youth have a chance to go down a different path than older generations did, and we must act now to be the generation who solved this crisis.

<br><hr>
I decided to comment on this post because I agree with the fact that so many climate change activists are telling us to act. And while I appreciate that Ken is reminding us to vote and to spread awareness to the people around us, I got a bit frustrated while watching this because I don't feel like that is enough. I want to have more control, and I become so irritated when I don't know how to make a larger impact. I feel I need more direction. Ken should assign us to write a letter to a politician, or to volunteer for environmental organizations. I just feel that I need more guidance than being told to vote.
     <br><br>
Still, I found the part about talking between generations very interesting. I often have trouble communicating to my extended family to not shop fast fashion. My aunt is obsessed with Marshalls, which sells cheap and unsustainably made clothing. This video will inspire me to pass on some of my knowledge to her, and remind her of the impact she is making by investing in these brands.

The fact that 3/4 of all the CO2 emissions that has caused our climate change came from the previous generation and the current generation (my peers and I) are the ones responsible for solving this disastrous issue that we ourselves did not initially cause is so mind blowing. As Professor Hiltner stated in the video, we do not have years to solve the issue, we need to act within the next few months if we want to have a future. The previous generation is the majority of the people in America who are ignorant and choose not to "believe" that climate change is real and is having detrimental effects on our planet. Even those who can see the damages it has caused so far do not stress the importance of the issue because it will not personally affect them so they have no reason to worry or want to promote change. The previous generation has gotten used to their convenient and wasteful lifestyles that they do not see any reason to change their ways now at an older age. That generation will continue to waste and exploit the little resources we have left and exponentially speed up climate change until the day they die. 

     <br><br>

Although there is a lot of pressure on my generation, I do believe that we are capable and strong enough to actually promote change and eventually find a sustainable way of life in order to slow down and eventually end the climate change issue. One of the strategies that I agree with most and believe is the most important in mitigating the climate crisis is encouraging my generation and everyone else to vote! The majority of people who vote in America is the same group of people who started the climate crisis in the first place. We can no longer allow the previous generation to control every aspect of our lives and our future. It is time we educate and encourage everyone in my generation to vote in order to save our future. The previous generation will not suffer, but we will. I believe that we have the courage and strength to take over and save our planet.

It is interesting to see professor Hiltner speak on behalf of his generation and apologizing for what they have done and urging younger generations to act differently than his own. I agree with Hiltner that voting is one of the most important things we can do if we want the right people representing us in Congress and to speak on our behalf on how we need to act in order to combat the climate crisis. It is really frustrating to think that many young adults in my generation do not go out and vote because I feel like it is our duty as citizens to vote certain people into power if we want to see a change when it comes to the climate crisis. As Hiltner has said before in lectures is that the current generation, Gen Z, can be the generation to turn things around for the better, but at the same time it is up to us to walk the walk not just talk the talk. Similar to Hiltner, I have an optimistic view about the future and I also have hope in my generation that we will do the right thing, and be the generation to turn away from fossil fuels and look to renewables and green technology as the future of our world.

It inspires me to hear that our generation has the power to fix the world before it's too late, especially when it comes from someone of Kens stature. I understand the difficulty apparent in the situation, and though it isn’t possible to remove all the old wave thinkers from office and high positions within corrupt fossil fuel companies immediately, the possibility of this occurring over time is extremely likely. As long as we can the majority of our generation’s population to begin voting in a=big elections and standing up to the man (fossil fuel companies) and protesting their unethical ways, I have a great feeling that our generation can finally begin to switch things back to how they are supposed to be.
     <br><br>


There exists an immense amount of ways our generation can be environmentally friendly and sustainable, mentioned by Ken in his lecture videos. One of the easiest yet more beneficial ways of helping sustain our earth is through diet. The mass amount of methane produced by the production of beef is disturbing, and making the simple switch from beef to chicken can have intensely helpful impacts on the world we live in. Taking it one step further, becoming vegetarian cuts out an even bigger amount of greenhouse gas production from the environment, thus keeping our ozone in tact for longer than it would have been without a change to vegetarianism. Nonetheless, this is only one way one can help, and if our generation begins taking part in not just this change but a load of others, then I truly believe we can be the ones to save our planet.

One of the most daunting issue's that I see over and over again through out the examination of the climate crisis, is the fact that the ones who have created this issue are the ones still in power controlling our government everyday throughout the United States. These are the generations that have grown up throughout United States on going push for the spreading of the democracy and American imperialism, and would stop at nothing to further the United States goals and "keep America great." For most of the boomer's lifetime they've grown up being told that the greatest threat to our world is the threat of the destruction of American Democracy. While this may have some truth to it, their attempts to keep American Democracy at ease had created a bigger threat. For the past years Americans have been busy insuring we continue to stay the strongest nation while we ignored our biggest threat to American Democracy, the climate crisis. Evidently, our biggest issue to American Democracy is the climate crisis because without an inhabitable planet, this would all be impossible. I believe Ken's activist strategy of family integration is the best strategy to educate our population on the effects of the ongoing climate crisis. Family is more likely to take your ideas and beliefs to heart rather than any other person.

After watching Ken’s lectures, I learned a lot. Especially how voting and talking to your parents can help our planet during the climate crisis. I knew that getting our generation to go out and vote is difficult, but I feel like the urgency to get politicians into office who will do something about our environment will inspire a lot of people to vote. Although we still have a long way to go in order to get all of our generation to vote, I hope we all encourage each other to make a difference and let our voices be heard into a generation that does not care what will happen to our planet. 
      <br><br>
I, for one, have never really talked to my parents about the climate crisis and how it will affect me or their future grandchildren. This video has inspired me to start a conversation with my parents and family about how the climate crisis will have severe consequences if we don’t do something about it. The next time I go home, I plan to talk to them about what is going on on our planet and how we can do something about it. Something as small as watching what we buy or not eating meat once a week. I have a lot of hope for our generation and the change that we will bring as we get older.

What stuck out to me especially in this second lecture video was how Hiltner brought to the attention of the ages of those in power in our government right now. This is very concerning to me because it makes it seem daunting how we can make any true change in the next 30 years, incredibly vital 30 years, for climate change when the older generation in power disregards our concerns with climate change. In our for my generation to “take control” is a feat that everyone wants to do, but when it comes to going out into the real world to do it we are judged and invalidated by powerful, older people in power because we are too young to understand the magnitude of events in their eyes.

I also found it interesting to see the ages of our elected officials in Washington DC. The more I've been thinking about it, the more I realize Ken's generation and the one before him have created a loop.

      <br><br>

The boomers are worried about staying alive and healthy, which in return, means that more machinery and thus emissions must be produced in order to keep them alive. Because they are alive, they are emitting through their diets, transportation, etc. just as everyone else is. Also, with them living longer, they are voting in big numbers and influencing elections to keep their own generation in power and thus the cycle continues. Now, I'm not saying I don't appreciate the medicines and technology that keep ALL generations alive, but they are definitely contributing to the climate crisis in that cycle. 

      <br><br>

In order for us to break this cycle, it really comes down to voter turnout. Older generations will not take our begging for change seriously unless we actually go out and do something about it in the elections. If we really consider the climate crisis to be an issue, there are enough of us that we can make a difference.

After watching these two videos, I concluded that the most important point is that our generation will face the most serious environmental problems. Therefore, we should shoulder the responsibility of protecting the environment. According to the professor's analysis, although climate change existed many years ago, people did not understand it at all, some people did not even realize it. Similarly, although governments have been around for a long time, they have not paid attention to this issue. The reason behind this may be that people are too optimistic, or the signs of environmental change are not obvious.

      <br><br>

Today, climate change has become more and more obvious. Our generation will receive more signals and also need to shoulder the responsibility of environmental protection. We should not only listen to the professor's opinions and solutions on environmental protection in class, but also have our own thinking and think about this problem from multiple perspectives. At the same time, we also need to be committed to passing this information to people around us, so that more people can understand, be familiar with, and participate in environmental protection.

      <br><br>

In these two videos, I am most shocked by the ranking of voters on the things they care most about. The ranking of global warming is so low. This effectively shows that people's consciousness is far from enough. Only through continuous publicity and learning can we continuously strengthen this awareness. Although our generation needs to shoulder the greatest responsibility, it doesn't mean that others don't need to do anything at all. Only when everyone pays attention to this problem can the current situation of our lives, animals and plants, and climate change be prevented.

I agree completely with what Jiao has stated in this video. The previous generation has failed, even after they knew about the problem, a majority of them still fall back on the ideas of the old world. This new generation has to try to get as many of the previous generations members on board and then move on. We need to, as a up and coming generation take on this enormous load. People are naturally stubborn, so it will not be easy, but if we as a generation can make steps in the right direction of this problem, other generations after us will see us as heros. I also agree that the lack of information transfer is killing our chances at this moment and that needs to changed. The first step to success is making people aware and raise their overall alertness on the subject.


<br><hr>
I couldn't agree with you more. In the last century, after the chaos of all kinds of war, people focused on recovering their countries with massive industries. People became more selfish, ignoring their impacts on the environment. And in the video, Ken talked about the time delay in this climate crisis. The ones who caused the climate crisis are not the ones who are suffering from it, thus they don't feel that they are responsible to act on it because the hit of their actions in the last century only occured in the recent two decades. We boomers are the one who's suffering from the influence of climate change and we're the one who is able to do something about it. For example, one of the solutions mentioned by Ken is through voting. 

      <br><br>

In order to make things better, like what you have said, we need to do more than just changing ourselves. We need to change our parents' mind by educating them, telling them the cliamate crisis that is happening, how it was created by them and how it harms us now. Even though we are the one who is controlling this world right now, we need to avoid things get worse by stopping them doing the same things they have been doing for decades.

Despite the fact that there's a present and alarming climate crisis, generations are divided on the severity of the issue. The fact that climate change is such a low priority for older generations should be the catalyst for the younger generations to take control of our futures. The people in power are not interested in the consequences of climate change, however, their decisions and actions actively escalate the crisis. The younger generation have the opportunity to use our votes to steer our future away from the climate crisis. 
      <br><br>


Change in the political sphere really resonated with me. I believe that individual actions will only contribute reducing emissions to a miniscule degree compared to what a nationwide policy change could entail. If the government was run primarily by a generation that cared about climate change, then such policies might a chance of becoming implemented. However, as things stand today, the people that actually have the ability to influence climate change doesn't care about it. While it would be nice to hope that the voices and messages of the younger generations will be heard by those in power, it's perhaps necessary to replace those in power,

I respect Ken for acknowledging his generation's negligence and shortcomings concerning global climate change. He makes it undoubtedly clear that my generation will have to fix the climate crisis. Moreover, I find ken's solution to this issue totally viable. My generation needs to simply vote more. The US is a leader in greenhouse gas emissions yet it has not done much to change this. If more people, who informed on the subject of climate change, voted then major changes would occur. The 'Green new deal' is an example of proposed legislation that aims to address the issues of climate change. As Ken said, we need to take control of this planet for change to occur.
      <br><br>


Another solution that caught my attention was the idea of "child to parent interchangeable learning". This is fascinating to me because I had recently talked to my mom about English 23 and what I have learned so far. It sparked a great conversation on climate change. Similar to myself, my mom was not aware that climate change was such an urgent issue.  I believe that simply talking to our parents about climate change will increase awareness of this issue and subsequently motivate more people to take action.

<p>
The first lecture made me think of the ways Baby Boomers are manipulated by the media. Politicians and other public figures online and on television are able to say whatever they want, true or not, and older people who didn’t grow up on the internet are more likely to believe these things whole-heartedly. Keeping in mind the large amount of republican Baby Boomers, this might explain why they ranked immigration and social welfare programs as more important issues than climate change. People like Donald Trump like to emphasize these issues as the things that are destroying our country, and when combined with climate denialism, Baby Boomers fail, to realize that the most pressing issue that is most likely to actually destroy the country is the climate crisis. 
       <br><br>
On a brighter note, the second lecture reminded me that young people like us still have the power to make a huge impact on the climate. 2018 was one of the most polarized and important elections of our lives, and as a result voter turnout of millennials was unusually high. Hopefully, we will all realize that 2020 is an even more important election and we will continue this trend of “rocking the vote”.

I find great frustration in that climate change deniers are so common, and that those who deny the change are most commonly from the older generations, those who will not be alive to have to deal with the results of their actions. Therefore, it makes logical sense that those fighting to prevent change are most commonly from younger generations who will have to deal with the results of change. I was lucky enough to have been raised by parents from the baby boomer generation who have acknowledged the problem since it was first introduced to to the public.
        <br><br>
Yet, the statistics stated in the first video about where each generation placed global warming in terms of issues, relative to the number of people who acknowledge climate changes existence is a demonstration of just how little these generations care about their descendants. Until a generation which will place the security of the future over profits, the future does not look hopeful. While I knew that in the past few years we had increased emissions due to the way the man who runs our country has been misusing his power, I was unaware we had increased emissions by over three percent. Until individuals can act in ways that benefit others, not just themselves, progress can not be made.




</p><hr>


<p>
Considering what Ken said in regards to how emissions have jumped to 2.7% just back in 2018, which is 5 times greater than when the Paris Accord was signed, makes me gravitate and responsive to taking control of the planet that much more. I was shocked to hear that only a third of registered voters under the age of 30 voted whereas registered voters above that age voted two times as much: which makes sense as to why nothing is happening on the political level. However, there should be a greater push than ever, in fact, it should be required for younger people especially to go and vote. Otherwise, until we can gain control we are limited to things like collective action or child to parent intergenerational learning—obviously not as effective as having absolute control over policy and law-making. Like Kennedy said, “We live in interesting times” and it is through these interesting times that younger populations need to be more politically active and not only voice their opinions but take action whether it be on the local level or larger levels, something needs to change. If anything we should be prideful for being at the forefront of climate-related change, as it is up to us to right the wrongs of previous generations.

<p>

I agree with Ken on what our generation should do to take action. The “Child to parent intergenerational learning” is something that shapes most people’s lives, whether they know it or not. Most people take on the values and morals of those who raised them, so if our generation can inspire the next generation to take care of our planet that will, in turn, bring about the biggest change. The minds of the future may be able to bring advancements of reusable resources such as solar panels, wind turbines, etc. When I see these pessimistic videos I feel sorry for the generations to come, but if we take action now we may be able to secure a sustainable future for our children, our children's children and so on.

Professor I thank you for taking responsibility for what your generation did, but you should not feel completely guilty. There was no way for you to stop the actions of billions of people. Hopefully my generation can solve the issues that we currently face in terms of our climate crisis. There are many ways we can counter this and I have some ideas. First, we need to stop supporting fossil fuels. The more we use fossil fuels, the more CO2 emissions we put out into the atmosphere. So, instead of driving a car, people should opt to ride a bicycle or skateboard to work. This isn’t possible for everyone, but if enough people did it, CO2 emissions would decline greatly. Another thing my generation can do is refuse to travel by plane. Traveling by plane is harmful to the environment and contributes to our carbon footprint. Also, switching to a plant based diet can help because one pound of beef is equivalent to 30 lentils. 
         <br><br>
I agree with Professor Hiltner that teaching our parents about climate change can help, but I feel like we should focus on the youth more. They are the ones that are gonna make the change. Hopefully things can improve.

As I watched "What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis," I had a realization when Ken stated the statistics regarding voters in the most recent presidential election. It is indeed a very large step forward with the massive increase in voters between the ages of 18-29. However, the older generation has a third more of its population that voted, showing that they completely control the outcomes of the elections. When he said this, I began to panic; will we not be able to combat this issue until this older generation is no longer around? Obviously, we are far past the time to act. We do not have any more time to waste, yet we will most likely not be able to elect political leaders who realize this is the nation's top priority. Unless the minds of the majority of the baby boomers are changed, this will significantly delay any progress of changing our excessive consumer culture. 
         <br><br>


Although my thoughts so far have been pessimistic, there are a few points from Ken's video that make me feel hopeful for the future. With much of the younger generations speaking out against these politicians who believe climate change is not a large issue, personally changing their own lifestyles, as well as encouraging others to do the same, this is largely the progress people have needed in light of the issue. And although the older generations care less or believe it is not an extreme issue, the younger generations will go on to raise the future generations and educating them on how to live an environmentally conscious life. With our generations as well as the ones that will follow, we will be the change that the world needs, it just may take a bit more time.

As a former climate crisis denier, my eyes were opened to the what was really going on when I first came to UCSB and took Ken's English 22 class on Literature and the Environment. For the past two years, I've been making steps toward what I consider an effort to combat the climate crisis in the only ways I really know how (thanks to Ken's classes and classes alike). For one, I have been committed to a plant-based diet for the past 10 months and it feels good to wake up and realize I am doing something, however small it may be in the main scope of things, to help the climate crisis slow down...However,  I never realized the importance of voting until I started believing in the climate crisis. Ken's point about the older generation outvoting the younger generation really opened my eyes to how easily and quickly my generation could turn this climate crisis around if people like myself just got out and voted. In all 24 years of my life, I have never voted once for anything as I grew up believing my vote wouldn't really make a difference. I am more motivated than ever to start voting whenever an election comes up-no matter what kind it is. When things feel hopeless and the anxiety about the climate crisis takes over, which happens to a lot of us, it will be easier to deal with knowing that for the most part, I can help in a huge way by just voting.

Child to parent education is a hopeful strategy that is not always going to work. I think it is still a good place to start and try to spread awareness and encourage an open mind for education. Watching this video made me think of how I became aware of the climate crisis and it was being exposed to information consistently through friends and social media. 
         <br><br>

I went vegan about a year ago for health reasons, but the environment ended up becoming one of the main reasons I continue to choose to. What has been cool is now my 17-year-old athlete of a little brother is vegetarian, my mom and her husband are pretty much vegan, and my roommates are consuming less animal products. There are so many reasons to not eat animal products and even though the environment was not my family's reason they are still helping the environment. I don't think I was the direct inspiration for any of these people changing their diets, I honestly believe I was just apart of consistent exposure which guides people through a new topic and can ultimately have the greatest impact. I think this is important to keep in mind with the climate crisis and also with voting turnout. Keep educating people.

It is very shocking to find out that 2/3 of people are not voting. Thanks to these videos I have come to understand how big of a political change we need. We need to all vote for people who believe in the climate crisis and are determined to do something about it. Most people I know have the ability to vote and still don’t because they feel lazy to do so. I am determined to talk to these friends and educate them on the climate crisis so they can finally wake up and vote and help create a change.
         <br><br>
One thing I really loved about this video was the advice on the  child to parent talk so that we can educate our parents. I feel like most parents are not even aware of all of thus. In the small city I live in, most people don’t even watch the news and there is rarely anything that can inform them about issues. I feel like informing are parents about the climate crisis is a great idea. Ken has gave me motivation and now I am very willing to do anything for the better of the future. Let’s all unite an work together now.

After watching these two lecture I completely understand that the climate situation is now in the hands of the younger generations, including myself. It is our complete responsibility to take action and educate our own children on the dangers of the climate in order to make a change. The recent poll which asked voters which would be most important upcoming in the upcoming 2020 elections, Baby boomers 18/29 ranked global warming as an area of concern with way higher votes on leading issues such as the economy, health care, terrorist and boarder protection. The Gen X (which are individuals ranging from 40s to mid 50s) ranked climate change as 15/29 which was not any higher than the baby boomers. Individuals older than 50 ranked climate change the lowest. This being said, it is extremely clear to me that the older you are the less urgent you find climate crisis. This factual evidence is not surprising because they are not going to be able to se the consequences of our actions. Although we can not make a change now because most of the boomers are in charge of our politics, we can and WILL take control of the future stance on climate change and the younger generations below the boomers. Even if our generation educates the baby boomers and beyond, the most common problem is denial. Even if individuals understood the warnings we give on the effects of climate change, there will be delay on taking action. Overall, the older generations do not regard climate change as a top priority issue because they will not be able to see the consequences of their actions. I still have hope for my generation and the newer generations to take action and push harder on the concerns for climate change because we and ultimately our children and grand children up ahead will severely face the impacts of the climate if we do not make any change.

I have never thought I could learn this much in this so-called ENG 23 class. In the past two weeks, after watching Professor Hiltner's videos and reflecting on myself, my family, and the people surrounding me. I compare and contrast what's the differences among us. Let me talk about my parents first. When every time I tried to "educate" them to be environmentally friendly like using reusable bags while shopping or smoking less often, they always had the same reaction, "none of our business". They think they don't have the ability to take care of or save our planet.That's what "god's thing" or what a government should do. No, it's not. After watching those short videos made by Ken. Yes, he is a professor. But he is not only a professor in my eyes now. He's making actions to educate his descendants or future generation like us. He inspired us to believe that we can make something and we must take this responsibility to make our earth more habitable. I have a lil brother. He's 7 now. When he was a little, I ask him to classify every single trash like paper, bottle, can, battery before he throw them away. Now he is being subconscious to classify the trash or sometimes he will keep the trash and sort them when he's back home. I can't even do this to be honest. However, I more to believe that we, the future generation, have the ability to come out new strategies, technologies to save our planet. This is our home and we must take responsibility of it!!

I have also learned so much about the climate change from my two weeks in this course, and have also reflected a lot on the issue as well. Specifically in the lectures that we watched, I have been thinking about the generational gap between younger adults and those over 60.  I  have always wondered why the older generations are more reluctant to believe in climate change and it does make sense that they do not believe in it due to the fact they they were not able to see the consequences. It is the younger generation has known the consequences and as well the generation that has to address the issue as well. 
         <br><br>
I think our professors solution in taking control of the planet is in fact a very strong solution. The climate crisis is too urgent to wait twenty to thirty years to be able to have political momentum in order to address the issue. It is very concerning that the professor said we do not have decades or even years to act on climate change, but this is the very reason as to why we must address this issue immediately. 
         <br><br>
I think one of the most important things that the professor mentioned is that political change is of utmost importance. When we become too focused on individualizing the climate crisis, specifically to those who are not rich nor have political power, we will notice that individual actions, such as riding a bike to work, will not have a strong, and more importantly lasting impact since we will not live on this planet forever. Like the example  the professor mentioned, what is the point of switching to an e bike if our local politicians are more interested in car infrastructure. A lot of the climate crisis has been caused by corporations who lack political regulation, and thus this issue is much larger than recycling at your own house. In addition, if we do not focus on the politics behind climate change, we will make other logical mistakes, such as equally blaming every individual for the state of our earth- which is unfair to the poorer 3 billion humans, and the children of the people who did this. 
         <br><br>
I think that it is interesting to see the impact of intergenerational learning as you have mentioned with your brother. Intergenerational learning can therefore work with any generation. Of the psychology and sociology courses I have taken, one thing of utmost importance is that we are for the most part a product of our socialization and interaction with others. By helping create a consciousness of the climate crisis with others, we are helping in making an impact on the issue.


<br><hr>

I empathize with your situation concerning your parents. Like it was said in the lecture video, older generations rank climate change of less importance than other issues such as social security. It is common for older generations to write climate change off since they have lived without experiencing immediate consequences. That being said, I find it ironic that the younger generation is educating the older generation about something that they are essentially responsible for. It is saddening that the younger generation has the burden of learning how to live without fossil fuels as we were born into the addiction. As you mentioned in your comment, by teaching the even younger generation to take measures into fighting climate change it becomes natural to a new generation to live within that lifestyle. The initial switch in older generations to become unaccustomed to the mass consumerism lifestyle I foresee to be rather difficult. Our upbringing of valuing having a lot of expensive items and having the biggest newest things is hard to unlearn when society overall still upholds those standards. As our generation becomes older, we begin to have more power in politics and media influences which brings hope. A big takeaway is the power of voting. As previously mentioned in the lecture, the older generation currently holds a majority of political power and climate change is just not one of their priorities. However, I believe that once our generation begins to take that political power, real change that follows the Paris Agreement will happen. This is due to growing up with the effects of climate change already showing which moves climate change up in our priorities and concerns.

Ken is 100% right when he stresses the fact that we need to take control of our own futures. The generations before us have made it very clear that they have little intentions of cleaning up their mess. As much as this frustrates me, and likely frustrates the rest of my generation as well, it’s unfortunately the reality we’re going to have to come to terms with. I wish that the “boomers” had to deal with the consequences so they would have the same urgency the rest of us do, but it’s just not something that’s going to happen. I wish that selfish businesses reliant on fossil fuels were willing to sacrifice some profit for the sake of the literal only planet we’re going to get, but it’s just not something that’s going to happen. We can use our frustration to keep yelling at the older generations in power to do something while they keep ignoring us, or we could use that drive to make the changes ourselves. We can’t wait to slowly fight our way into high-power government positions; the planet doesn’t have that much time. 
         <br><br>


The child-to-parent intergenerational learning method Ken suggested is one I really would like to utilize myself. I come from a family of 6, and I can’t even begin to imagine the density of our carbon footprint. We have 4 cars parked in our driveway currently, three of which require filling up their large gas tanks at least once a week. I’m not blaming my parents; it’s hard not to have a large carbon footprint when you have to transport four kids to four separate schools and still make it to work on time an hour away, only to repeat the same drive to pick all of them up later that day. There’s definitely more we can be doing, though, to combat the severity of our contributions to the climate crisis. If I can explain the level of damage we’re currently reckoning on my siblings and I’s futures, I’m hopeful my parents will realize that we need to change our lifestyle in order to take hold of our own futures. I encourage my classmates to do the same.

I think that a very big part of what my generation needs to do is get out and vote for people who will make changes toward a more environmentally friendly government. If more of our generation voted I believe we could take control of the government and really influence the world and we need to do that as soon as possible to cause the least amount of harm to the planet. Our generation can also make small changes to their lives to help solve these problems. This is such as Ken mentioned with the consumption of less goods. Minimalism is a very good idea because it limits consumption to the maximum, and also has been proven to increase happiness. Also people don’t realize that consumption does not make them happier, and that it is relationships and purpose and such that make people happier. I believe that saving the environment is part of my purpose and therefore minimalism fits into my purpose. I have adopted a couple changes to my life to help lessen my carbon footprint such as not consuming beef and also purchasing less. I have also talked to my parents about these topics, although they already believed in climate change and saw it as a pressing issue. Yet I was able to inform them of some things they could do to lower their carbon footprint.

Though I agree with Professor Ken, it is hardly could our generation simply solve this environmental crisis just by gaining power. The politics consists lots of parts and the government is only one part of a political system of a country. Other influencing parts such as capitalists will only focusing in their money. They will apart from the saving the planet just for more money. It is not only simple as passing power to our generation, it is about to change the whole entire political system to focus on saving the environment that we live in.

Seeing as how more and more people are raising awareness and campaigning for increasing younger voter turnout, I think that the issue of the past generations neglecting our voice won't be a concern for much longer. When comparing the 2014 and 2018 midterm election cycles, younger voter turnout (18-29 years old) increased from 20 percent to 36 percent which is insane (https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html)! Also, I feel that many politicians of that past generations are starting to become more informed about the issue of the climate crisis and are starting to take more action or at least are becoming more ambivalent to the idea which further shows that hope is not lost in the slightest. Finally, I would like to commend Professor Hiltner for mentioning the idea of children informing their parents about certain issues. Although many parents might be initially stubborn in accepting what you are saying as truth, with enough persistence, they will put aside that mental block and become more aware about the climate crisis. The more people practice this child parent intercommunication, the more that the public will prioritize the issue of global warming and thus we can help to avert ourself from continuing down this path of self-destruction.

One of the ways that we can change the ideas of people in political power is by changing the way that the public thinks. Politicians will do anything that the public wants in order to get elected in position so if we stop the express our thoughts about climate change to the people in power we can help our planet now. We are moving toward the right way in my opinion if “70% of voters now know that Climate change is an issue,” but the only problem about this is that it isn’t a priority to them. As Professor Ken said, “75% of Carbon emission has happened in the past 60 years,” making it perfect for people in power because they are usually 60 years old and counting yet they don’t care much about it making it below in their priority list because it isn’t affecting them directly as of right now and it won’t be affecting them in the future because they won’t be on this planet. The sad truth is that older generations don’t care as much as newer generations because of this simple-minded reasoning. Yea everyone says we have to help the planet now and they only ones who truly care aren’t in power because we are too young and we can’t convince the ones who are in power so it puts our generation in a very difficult situation. We need to get all of the older generations to think in a broader spectrum and make them care about future generations and not just themselves they have to think about what will help everyone in the future and not what can help them right now in time.

What I find lovely is that Professor Hiltner encourages us to take control of this and trusts us to take care of this planet in general. He has a lot of faith in us which I don’t refute. After all, the previous video points out Generation Z’s care over the climate crisis being much greater than the other two olders one. This responsibility surely carries a lot of weight because we don’t have a lot of time. We don’t have time to wait for events to happen and we have limited days to act because the previous generation wasted decades and used those years to worsen things. Any continued negligence will arguably catalyze the consequences to come. 
         <br><br>

I liked how he mentioned biking, but also noted how unrealistic it can be if authorities focus on more road infrastructure and not bike paths or lanes. Realistically, he left the advice to vote. We need those in power to stand alongside us; we need those in power to care for our futures to exist. We can’t wait for our generation to be old enough to take over, but we need to control who gets authority and what they do and that is through using our voices, using our votes, and using a whole lot of pressure. Moreover, one of the most effective approaches Professor Hiltner states is intergenerational education. This is the transfer of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors from children and parents. I honestly do believe in needing to teach parents by communicating to them as I come from a traditionally asian household whose culture can only deviate from typical western ways. My mom is very open though, LGBT-friendly and welcoming to others. However, she has a large disconnect to politics. As a first year Political Science major, I am fascinated with what I learn and described to my mom the historical significance of Trump’s impeachment which only led to her giggling. She commented on her disconnect of politics and how she didn’t know why I’d be talking about politics with her, but nevertheless said she enjoyed hearing that I am knowledgeable over relevant topics. I believe the subject of climate crisis is easier to comprehend, but ultimately, I can educate my mom by leading her to being conscious of emissions and eco-friendly and informing her of the platforms of the presidential candidates. I think it would make a difference, from getting her to use her vote for good beliefs and starting her off with baby steps (cutting down on waste in the kitchen as an example).
         <br><br>

I am excited for the next segment to learn how we can begin to reconstruct western culture in more depth and specifics!

I have to agree with Ken in that we have to take action now. There are many naysayers or even those who actually believe in the cause but say it’s not that easy, such as our very own senator Dianne Feinstein (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEPo34LCss8). But in this era where information can spread like wildfire through the internet, I believe that the younger generation will have their voice heard in our government.
         <br><br>

 Ken is right when he says that one of the major ways that we can make a difference is to VOTE. It may seem like your single vote won’t make much of a difference, but if everyone who is committed to the cause and eligible to vote band together, we can make a noticeable impact. 
         <br><br>

 It may seem unfair for the younger generation to take responsibility for the damage that the climate crisis will have on future generations, but Ken gives us another viable solution to get the older generation involved as well. Through child to parent intergenerational learning, we can teach the older generation about how devastating the climate crisis is and can become if we don’t take action now. By using this technique we can prioritize climate change as an issue that needs immediate attention in our government. Though this may take some time, I believe that the older generation does care about the planet, but they haven’t been exposed to all the data and predictions for what the world might look like for their future generations. Once they are also well educated on the topic, they can help create change for the whole planet.

Both these lecture videos provided many interesting points to me that made me really think about my actions and their effects on the world. I found it interesting how Ken talked about his generation knowing that climate change was happening a long time ago, but chose not to do anything about it. While climate change can be blame on the older generations who definitely made a significant impact on this world, we shouldn't put all the blame on them. Not every person from one generation made our climate this bad today, it was only a few people making decisions for the majority that caused it. I think we have to recognize that the problem is not from people's negligence, it comes from larger groups in power choosing not to make change due to certain circumstances. It is our job as a generation to change those lawmaker's viewpoints in order to secure a safe future for generations to come.

I agree completely, regardless of who is to blame for the climate crisis, it needs to be fixed. There is no point of sitting around and trying to point fingers at who did it, we do not even have the time to waste as action is needed now. While some hold the mindset that their generation will not have to address these problems, unfortunately, all of humanity will need to deal with the consequences, as they are anything but in the future. With how we have been treating climate change now, we couldn’t look our children in the face and tell them that at least we really fully tried to salvage their futures. The safety of our planet is paramount and we must turn to any idea even small in an attempt to solve the climate crisis. Any step even small is a step in the right direction!

I agree with Ken when he describes the lack of effort from past generations toward saving our environment. Past generations are simply negligent to our influence on the environment. they simply have such a capitalist mindset, thinking that increasing the amount of cash in their pocket is the most important thing versus the survival of our world and future generations. We simply need to move past their stubbornness and work on saving the world ourselves.

After watching the two lecture videos, I get more insight into not only why the climate crisis has happened, but also how to address the issue. I was taught about that the climate is badly changing, the greenhouse effect, and the necessity to solve the climate problem since I was in elementary school, so it is hard to believe there are still some people refuse to admit the severity of climate crisis. I am optimistic on this issue, and I believe that the climate crisis can be solved, or at least to be mitigated, in our generation. It is our responsibility to resolve the mistake made by the previous generations.



</p><hr>


<p>
There is power in numbers. It is our generations job to come together and fight for a change. I like how in the lecture video Ken not only encouraged us to vote, but encouraged us to tell 5 of our friends to vote. If there is an increase in the number of young individuals who vote, it is more likely that politicians who prioritize climate change will be put in office. This is crucial because politicians hold the true power to make a difference. 
         <br><br>

I am curious about how my grandparents prioritize climate change while they are voting, after learning that individuals over the age of 75 prioritize climate change as the 23rd out of 29 topics. I am going to make it a point to ask them how they feel about the issue the next time I am back home. Maybe the child-to-parent inter-generational learning will work with grandparents as well. If my grandparents don’t see climate change as a pressing issue already, I am hoping that I can discuss it with them, and demonstrate to them that it is in fact an important issue.

I appreciate Ken for being so encouraging towards our generation and telling us that we have the power to mitigate the climate crisis.  I love how in each video he calls out his own generation for being the least active about this issue and being the ones responsible for causing the most damage to our planet.  However, I hope that by encouraging our generation, it doesn’t result in discouraging other generations.  I would hate for the large burdens of the climate crisis to only be placed on the shoulders of our generation by having others feel they don’t need to assume any responsibility.  Although “take control of the planet” is a very broad and daunting task, I believe the education my generation has received on this issue will effectively aid the ways in which we go about attempting to mitigate this crisis.  As we continue to learn about the climate crisis both in and out of the classroom, I believe this will fuel a generation that is more passionate than any in the past. 
         <br><br>


Because there are so many ways that we can help to mitigate the climate crisis, I would hope that it doesn’t all seem overwhelming for my generation.  I am certain that this is highly unlikely because there are so many young environmental activists that are passionate about educating the world about the climate crisis.  Everyday my generation is reminded of the urgency of this issue because of our rapid access to social media.  We are living in a world where this information is spread so rapidly that we are feeling more and more urgency everyday.  I hope that we can not only be models for the future, but models for the past as well.  Because of all this, the question of “Where do we begin?” looms over our heads and is the deciding factor of just how impactful our actions will be.

I agree with what you have to say and hope to maintain an optimistic approach about what our generation can do about the climate crisis. The reason I chose to take this course had nothing to do with earning a GE, in fact it wasn’t approved for any at the time of registration--I really wanted to be informed and inspired and most of all be given advice on what to do as a 20 year old living in the time period where climate action needs to happen now. 
         <br><br>


This video gave me great advice on things I can do to help our current situation. For example, I now understand how important it is to not only vote but also encourage 5+ more friends to as well because there is strength in numbers. The older generation dominates the polls just because we don’t care to go and that needs to change. I also found the child to parent inter generational learning to heart and know that this method would definitely work with my family. My parents are my main supporters and I know they would make changes in their lives if they saw me doing so in mine. Ken is so right to encourage us to make this a personal issue where our parents can understand that while this might not affect their generation, it will affect ours and our grandchildren and that is something they will definitely care about. I’m excited to put these tidbits of advice into practice and hope others do the same.

Although I found it empowering that Ken said it is our generation's time to take control, it is a little scary and unfair as well. As previous generations have done, I'm scared that our generation will just be another one that will follow the tradition of previous ones who hurt the environment with greenhouse gasses, but I'm also hopeful that I can be a part of a generation that will make fighting climate change a top priority in the United States. I feel good that I'm an active voter who supports candidates who take climate change seriously, but the fact that only 1/3 of "young" people vote is disheartening. I am making decisions, albeit ever so gradually, that are helping reduce my carbon footprint and helping fight climate change in general as are several other environmentally conscious individuals which is great; however, I think implementing laws and policies at the local, state, and federal levels will make the biggest difference in attaining goals set in the Paris Agreement for example.

         <br><br>

By introducing bills that turn into laws, people will be held to a higher standard to combat climate change. Implementing things like a carbon tax will undoubtedly put us on a good track to decrease the rising temperatures, ocean levels, and natural catastrophes. Although many people may not agree with carbon taxing, it will definitely save lives, both human and animal. I think it's hard for people to see how climate change is negatively affecting our world, because people across the world, like citizens of Bangladesh, are affected by climate change the most. Additionally, since climate change's effects aren't as immediate and clear to see as stocks are, I understand why some people are lackadaisical about making an immediate impact in helping combat it. Nonetheless, I think introducing laws related to fighting the climate crisis is an absolutely necessary step that needs to be taken to successfully counter climate change before reaching a tipping point.

I completely understand how you feel about this all being unfair. We have to clean up the mess, we have to deal with the consequences, all while having been trained to find happiness in consumerism and cars and meat and all the things that hurt the environment more. It's unfair to us, and even more unfair to those who live in countries that did not impact the climate anywhere near as much, but must feel its wrath twice as hard. We at least benefited from these emissions, but we like anyone will feel the negative effects. I hope you turn your justified anger into action!

         <br><br>

If you want more young people to vote, you have to make it happen! If you're eligible, vote! If you have friends, tell them to vote! If you have a platform, use it! Voter registration is easy, and mail-in voting is as well. There is no excuse to not vote. There is nothing we can't change if our generation works together. Some people think their single vote can't make a difference. Their right. BU their vote, plus their friend's votes, plus their friend's friends vote? That can and will. Do you remember those chain emails from middle school? Imagine their reach, but instead of you being haunted if you don't pass it on, the corrupt and greedy are voted into office.

         <br><br>

Even local government can make a change, and your vote matters so much more. There are roughly 90,000 people in Santa Barbara. 20,000 people go to UCSB. 15,000 people go to SBCC. Those numbers are on our side. If green initiatives work in Santa Barbara, we can inspire other towns and cities and even the entire country. Change starts small but spreads fast.

I greatly appreciate that Ken, being a part of the boomer generation, can acknowledge the work that must be done by my generation. It is frustrating to watch our generation be treated as ignorant or too young to understand the issues that plague our society. I look forward to the time in which we have a strong voice in politics, but I am disappointed that we have the opportunity to express our opinions through voting, yet only around 1 in 3 young people voted. I feel as though many people in my generation see elections as irrelevant as we are not concerned with the topics commonly brought up, such as healthcare. However, because we don’t take as much initiative as the older generations do, we are setting ourselves up to have less of a voice in our government. When discussing the democratic debate with my friends this past week, we all decided that our most pressing issue was the climate crisis. Although climate change was brought up at multiple points throughout the debate, it is evident that politicians largely market towards older generations because they make up the majority of voters. I am hoping that our generation will step up and take control of our planet as Ken urges us to.

I am also frustrated by our generation's lack of involvement in politics and voting. It is also in a way empowering how much potential there is for us to influence politics and how different things could be if we could raise the 1/3. You explain it well, and it really is a cycle. We vote less, politicians care about our issues less, we care less, we vote less. I hope this next election will be a turning point and we will break the cycle by showing up and proving our power as a force for change. It is cool that you and your friends talk about the debates together. Simple things like that could increase voter turnout by a lot. If people extend their passion to discussion with friends, we could increase our generation's involvement. I really like the way Ken ended this lecture with this description of our time as the most creative, with so much potential for change and improvement. We need to people see that they do have a voice and that their personal everyday decisions are impactful.

After watching these lecture videos I felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety and hopelessness. Ken addresses one of the biggest reasons the U.S. has yet to make strides in slowing climate change, and that is because of the people in power. The governors, congress, supreme court and current president are majority baby boomers or older, and these are the people who’s lifetime exactly lines up with the timeline of ¾ of CO2 being emitted into our atmosphere, as Ken stated about himself as well. They are still in denial that climate change is even real! Contrastly the majority of my generation want to make a change because we still have lives to live and future generations of our own families and of humans and life everywhere to keep safe. If we continue at the rate we are, things are going to get much worse, very fast. It genuinely scares me how ignorant and stubborn the leaders of my country are acting and putting the future of all humans and all life on earth at risk. I do understand that on the ‘left’ and ‘right’ of U.S. politics there are extremists, but there is no need to continue looking at every issue as black and white or liberal and republican. It creates more fighting and less resolving. The same way that climate change denial won’t get us anywhere, shaming and scaring people to go vegan or buy an electric car won’t help either! We need to work TOGETHER. I’m not sure how scientific this solution is, but I’ve always believed that if enough people chose to make a small change it will create a large impact. The fact that the U.S. along with some European and Asian countries are contributing the most to the climate crisis, just goes to show that if all of those people made big or small changes we would see immense results. We are responsible so we owe it to the animals and people of less developed countries to save the planet.

In the video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis”, I agree with Kenneth that we need to take action and that waiting isn't an option anymore as climate change is already here. Ken’s idea about educating your parents and others is most likely to have a big impact. I talked to my parents about climate change and they were surprised with most of the information I was telling them. They knew climate change was real but didn’t know the effects that it will have and is already having on the Earth. Our generation needs to take charge and needs to educate people about the crises that we all are facing. Ken is right that we need to start the conversation and inform people of what is going on and how we can fix it. We can’t wait because generations before us have waited too long and waiting more will be devastating in the future. Waiting for policies to be created and wait for the government to help will take to long. Younger generations like Kenneth said we need to take charge before we too make the same mistake of waiting too long. The video is a call to action for us to take control of the situation not only for our generation but for the generations to come and the animals that have done nothing but are facing the same fate.

I have always found frustrating the idea that as long as the people who are in power remain in power, there is not much a chance for change at the political level. However, I think it is amazing that younger generations, such as Millennials and Gen Z have been so passionate about the issues of climate change, after all it is our future. Many of us have the ability to make choices in our day to day lives that can help reduce the damages to our planet, such as riding our bikes or walking to class rather than driving, or buying locally sourced foods, even going vegan. However, it can be tough to make these changes as many people do not want to give up their commodities (which sucks), even if it’s what we have to do to help the climate crisis. However, since we are a generation that follows trends more than anything else, and if we can make these sustainable ideas “trendy,” we can make a huge difference. For example, I think almost every person I know my age has a hydroflask, like every person. Though it's a trend, it’s great because it helps reduce the amount of plastic water bottles thrust into the world. If we decide it's "cool,” all of a sudden every company everywhere is designing something to follow that trend or lifestyle, the more we push for good things such as reusable water bottles or sustainable clothing lines, the better things will be. As a nation, we are extremely consumer-driven, always wanting the newest whatever, and if we start demanding products that are made ethically, sustainable and eco-friendly, we will saturate the market. Realistically, no one wants to give up their consumer habits, that’s a huge issue as we rely on our industries for everything, and yes, we may be passionate about climate change but we also know full well we want to be able to “follow the trends” or buy this or that, so, we can use that desire to decide that only these types of products should be in our market.
         <br><br>


It is our job to turn things around, or at least help our planet, even if we don’t hold all the power, our small choices and influencing habits can help change what we can until it’s our turn to be in power.

Unfortunately, countries are currently led by people who care the least about the climate issue, and my assumption is that they will not be harmed by the disasters in the future, when they are probably no longer alive, while they are still alive and in power. Skeptical and negligence are really the huge stones that block us from making any progress. 
         <br><br>

It’s really parallel to see the generation which brings in the climate issue caress the least about it as well as regions contribute the least to this crisis suffer the climate change the most. Animals, the group that barely has any responsibility in this change suffers mass decline in their numbers and even distinction. I agree with the idea that the youngest generation, us, is the most helpful segment of society in connecting the older generations with the future generations. It might seem hard to totally change the situation, but it is the most effective way to tell our parents about the climate crisis. Family approach is probably the best approach to this issue because many people don’t worry about it unless it brings loss to them, but families can make them feel related to this problem.

After watching these two lectures I realized how important it is for my generation to “take over the planet” as Ken said. Although I agree with what was said in both lectures I can’t help but think about the lack of power we have in regards to people in congress, the supreme court, and CEO’s of companies that are causing harm to our environment. I understand that one day it’ll be my generation in those seats but will it be too late by then? Although the average ages of people in powerful positions did slap me across the face I am still optimistic and believe that we can create change even if we are not in a position of power. Voting, using vehicles less, recycling, changing our diets, and participating in movements to hopefully get more people so change their lifestyle is very important.
         <br><br>

Ken touched on consumer culture and how bad it is in western culture. I couldn’t agree more and I must admit that I am also guilty of participating. From wanting the newest iPhones to being a consumer of fast fashion we are not just hurting our planet by using its resources we are also hurting people in undeveloped countries. They are the ones who oftentimes make our clothing which then leads to them polluting their country bc of our wants. We might not see the consequences as much because of the country we live in but we need to change the way we live before our planet becomes uninhabitable.

The older generation that caused climate change deny that it is truly happening. Some reasons they use to deny climate change is happening is by saying that scientists are corrupt or that their tools don’t really work. They deny it because they did not see the effects of what they did in their lifetime, my generation is seeing it. Denial about climate change is largely in the developed world, which are the people that created the situation. Rich countries caused climate change, but poor countries are the ones that are going to feel the consequences the hardest. I thought it was interesting when Ken talked about the three groups who should be the most upset about climate change, the more than half poor people in the world, the animals, and the younger generation who are the kids of the older generation that caused it. I also thought the part where Ken talks about what Baby Boomers find the most concerning interesting, because it just proves that a lot of the older generation do not believe in climate change or believe its an important issue that needs to be fixed now. They care more about their social security and things that affect them right now than things that are going to affect their kids and future generation family members. Only 70% of registered voters believe the climate is changing due to human action, although it has gone up, it is still not as high as it should be. I find upsetting that now it is up to us, the younger generation, to fix what the older generation caused. It is a lot of pressure to try to fix something we don’t know how to fix, because if it’s not fixed it can be the end of humans all together. We don’t really know what exactly will happen to us once we start to see the effects more and more, but we do know that it will lead to the death of thousands of people. I agree that we need to vote at every election, because if we don’t then the same Baby Boomers will continue to elect people that benefit them instead of voting for people that will actually take action. I agree with Ken when he says that the older generation will be dead and buried when the younger generation is still around dealing with the most severe consequences. I also agree with Ken that youth rebellions have created real change before and we can do it again with this cause.

Often when young people are growing up they are constantly reminded to respect their elders. I have no problem with this and think that it is incredibly important to respect everyone, but sometimes this idea is taken to extremes. Many young people have a lot to say but feel like they are not allowed to challenge the people in charge or fear that they will not be taken seriously. This generational gap in communication and the overall power imbalance is an issue that if not solved will stop us from taking the corrects steps to combat anthropogenic climate change. Professor Hiltner’s suggestion that children should educate their parents is a step in the right direction because it will start to bridge the gap between our generations. I am fortunate to have parents that are incredibly willing to learn about the climate crisis and have actually made changes to how they live since I took English 22 last quarter. My father, who majored in environmental studies in college, thanked me for keeping him accountable because he realized that he had slacked on his dedication to our planet over the years. Although not all parents will be willing to listen I hope that others can share their knowledge with someone from an older generation to help open a line of communication.

         <br><br>

Another strategy for making young voices heard is through the power of voting. It is very concerning to see how little of my generation is voting especially when compared to the older generations. With the opportunity to register so readily available it makes it even more frustrating that people are not exercising their right to vote. In today’s political climate it is even more important than ever that we vote because our government is under the control of a generation that is unwilling to believe in the severity of climate change. Our current government dismisses any attempt at passing laws that will make real change. We need to break the tradition of having people come into governmental power in their 60s because we do not have the time to wait. 
         <br><br>


As Professor Hiltner said we drastically need to reinvent Western culture if we want to save the planet. We live in a country fueled by a desire to be rich, the supposed “American Dream,” and this has led to several issues. Americans have a serious issue with overconsumption and tend to buy things without thinking about their ethical and environmental costs. We need to seriously reconsider our priorities and shift our thinking when it comes to buying things. I do think that our generation will be able to shift at least some aspects of our culture, starting with our diets. Increasingly more and more people are incorporating at least some aspects of a vegan diet into their lives and ending the typical meat-centric culture of America. Another aspect of the culture I think that we will be able to change is in buying homes. With the rise of tiny homes and micro apartments it is easy to imagine a future without people building or buying mega mansions. Although these are just two examples of cultural shifts I do think that a major shift is possible if enough people are willing to change their ways and challenge the norms set by the generations before us. 

         <br><br>

Overall I am pretty overwhelmed knowing that it is on our generation to mitigate this crisis, but I look forward to hearing what else Professor Hiltner will suggest in future lectures.

I actually did not expect this solution (that of child to parent intergenerational learning) to be suggested. In fact, I believe this is the first time an idea like this had been brought up to me. I am used to the typical ideas of changing my lifestyle (buying less, taking non-carbon-intensive transportation, following a plant-based diet, etc.). Though I imagine this can be quite difficult for many others, I feel that it is definitely possible for many to accomplish. Given many parents would care about the well-being of their children, I can imagine this approach would make the climate crisis more of a concern to parents. It was interesting how the idea that national security was ranked higher on the list of concerns for older generations. Yes, there’s a chance our country could be in danger (from other countries), but this is only a possibility. Climate change is guaranteed and is considered a concern for the security of everyone in our country and outside of it. In this sense, climate change poses a threat to our safety, a frame I feel that people in older generations would not see as clearly.

<p>
One of the resolutions that Ken provided in this video struck me as really interesting and overall a great solution to the worldwide crisis. I strongly believe that creating groups such as the LGBTQ community and the civil rights movement is the best way to create fundamental changes in our society. The evidence is right here, those groups have fundamentally changed how our society operates. Hopefully, with enough people protesting against the issue, our voices will be heard and we can initiate change. If we act on an individual basis, our chances of changing the climate crisis are minimal and there is only so much we can do on our own to mitigate the global changes. By creating associations or national groups we can find a basis to act upon collectively and spread awareness worldwide.
         <br><br>


Touching on the child to parent intergenerational education, I also strongly believe that it is a great strategy to subvert global warming. However, as Ken said, we have simply run out of time. The time to act to hopefully save our planet from more destruction is now. We do not have enough time to wait until the next generation to fix the issue at hand. What we can hope for is that if our generation stops emitting as many greenhouse gases, we can then teach our children to live in the same manner. As such, as more generations are born, people will grow up to acknowledge climate change and change their lifestyles to preserve the biosphere.




</p><hr>


<p>
I highly believe the reason that the last generation refuses to accept the horrible consequences the climate change will bring to us, to the earth, is they are too afraid to admit they are the major culprit to cause the destruction. They are reluctant to acknowledge the damage the next few generations will suffer is because of their greed to utilize fossil fuels to highly develop the economy, which highly increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the past several decades. Then, time delay between the terrifying consequences and the already increased temperature is their perfect excuse for denying the theory puts forth by the scientists in that during their entire life, it seems that the increased temperature has not done any destructive damage to the society. Nevertheless, the global warming will indeed bring irreversible harm to the youth and their decedents if we still refuse to take action now. Therefore, it is the young generation’s duty to avoid escalating the climate change problem.
         <br><br>

Although as the new generation, the strength of us is little comparing to our last generation, who leads almost all the authoritative department, we can approach the success step by step. Firstly, if we want to influence others’ attitudes towards the global warming problem, we should set an example first. As we learn from the lecture that methane is the major culprit leading to the global warming and the cow is part to blame for increasing the methane, we can start to reduce eating beef to curb the emission. Secondly, professor Hiltner mentioned the child to parent intergenerational education in the lecture, which is an effective way to convert our family members’ attitudes towards the climate change problem. We can impart the knowledge and the horrible consequence we learnt from the lecture to our family members. For instance, the documentary “Fire in Paradise” is a good evidence to show them that we are closely related to the climate change and we should take actions now ! The strength of individuals may be weak, but the strength of the collective is strong enough to change the world!

After watching these two videoes, I have a more in-depth and overall understanding of the issue of climate change, to have a look at what I have learned in ENG 23 last 2 weeks. I completely agree with the idea presented in this video about the importance of education, and it is the people who have more power that have more responsibilities to take control of the situation. Thank Ken for letting me know the tight connection between government policy and climate change.

I love that Ken described parent-child intergenerational learning because I was watching both of these lecture videos with my parents. Even though I’ve been discussing the issues that I worry about, like the environment, with my parents for many years (not always a calm conversation), I hadn’t thought about the fact that if most of my generation does this, we can have a huge influence on the entire Baby Boomer generation. At UCSB, the grassroots aspect of my activist work is mostly focused on students, who communicate totally differently from my parents’ generation. Talking with my parents about these issues, like the climate crisis, can be so difficult, but the communication skills we’re both building will definitely help us in the future. 
         <br><br>

It’s hard to keep working on this issue, but like Ken said, we just don’t have time to not work on it. I really liked how Ken highlighted voting as well. Millennials and Generation Z are now the largest group in the electorate, and if we vote, we will have the power to “take control over the planet”, or at least the United States. Once young people vote, politicians are going to be forced to address young people’s concerns - like climate change - or lose their election. Even though our task seems unimaginable, to change our entire culture and value system, we have to stay positive and believe we can do it all together.



</p><hr>


<p>
I definitely agree that those who primarily passed policies and regulations to allow climate change to progress the way it did are still in power. This is disappointing because while we have amazing young climate change activists like Greta Thunberg and AOC, they don’t have enough power and traction in policy making. They’re making great strides, but with more elected officials in power who also support the same thing, I think greater change can happen now. 
         <br><br>

My main takeaway from Professor Hiltner’s video is this: “One of the most effective things you can do to create environmental change is to vote for politicians who can cause change.” I didn’t know that 2/3rds of us weren’t voting and that is enough to make a significant impact if we all get involved now. The ending of this video left me inspired about what we can do at this point to shape a new world and keep our planet inhabitable.

One of the many vital points that Professor Hiltner talks about is how in order to take action against climate change, we must rethink and fundamentally revolutionize consumerism and the meaning of happiness in the developed world. I can not agree to this more. Today, everyone wants to live the so called "American Dream", which embodies a lifestyle full of extravaganza and excess wealth. To be fair, I don't think anyone will reject wealth and an economically fulfilled life. However, many of us don't realize that an abundance or an excess of money and materials doesn't necessarily have a direct correlation to what we perceive will bring us-happiness. If the ultimate goal of humankind is happiness, then when are we going realize that the very literal basis of what our happiness and fundamental needs is built on, the earth, will soon cease to survive if humankind don't start saving it from our own greed and false sense of fulfillment? Without basic grounds for safety and survival, metaphorically and quite literally, life will no longer exist and the need for wealth and everything else becomes of little to no importance. Hence, if the developed world could just try to dissociate the false sense of relationship between wealth and happiness, I think the actions taken against the climate crisis will soon follow.

In class we looked at a comment that mentioned that my generation benefits greatly from the fossil fuel use of Kens generation. It is an important point that although we have benefited greatly from fossil fuel use and industrialization, it was not our choice, and we are now forced to deal with the consequences of others actions. 
         <br><br>

Ken mentions that most government and high up officials in companies are of his generation, and they are not doing anything to act on climate change. Although I appreciate the call to action, whos to say my generation actually is going to be more inspired to make change? Laws are created after a disaster happens and there is a reason to implement that law, they are very rarely preemptive. Considering this, the idea of acting in the next few months and that we do not have years to wait, although I agree with this sentiment seems unrealistic to me.

Yes, I totally agree with you. Yes, we have benefited from fossil fuels and now we have to fix something that we are not responsible for. Was it worth it? Have we benefited enough or are we losing in the long term? To me it feels as if we are losing, industrialization/modernization was not worth it ,now we have to fix a worldwide problem in a very restricted time frame.  Much of the older generation does not believe in climate change or it is not at the top of the priority. The older people, the people who have caused this, we need them to be on the same page as us to support us and help create laws to fix climate change. Climate change is affecting countries who have not contributed to this problem, animals, and us the new generation. Three quarters of all CO2 has been put in the last decades…. That is literally insane. We know that climate change is happening, what we need to know is how to fix it. Actions speak louder than words so how do we really take on climate change?

After watching two lecture videos from Professor Ken Hiltner, I completely agree with his opinions. People from the old generation believe that humans can’t impact the environment, and climate change is not a crisis. For them, the benefit and profit always are the first priority for them. It’s hard for us to persuade them. Our lives are just beginning. We can’t just sit there and watch them to keep emitting tons of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. We can’t let them just destroy our future. It’s time for us to do something. 

         <br><br>


There are many hopes for our generation. Although we don’t have much power to change the world right now as the new generation, we soon will be the future’s new leader. Now, we can start with little things first to reduce our carbon footprint.  If we can keep the climate crisis in mind, it’s very possible to come out with a way to solve this problem and improve the environment. Our education is also important for the next generation.

The generation gap definitely creates a barrier within the importance of climate change. It frustrates me that there is a barrier between economic importance and the severity of climate change between the generations. But we’re running out of time for these generations to argue which has greater importance. The conversation of climate change is everything political and the first step to creating positive change, begins with our politics. We need to be in control of our future and stop letting the generation who doesn’t care about climate change be in power. We need leaders, not deniers. Our future is already being destroyed and I couldn’t agree more with you, “our lives are just beginning.” 
         <br><br>
We cannot let economic importance outweigh the severity of climate change. We need to act now; it is up to our generation to make a lasting impact. We need political change.



</span></div><hr>



<p>
If I were to pick one thing that I learn from these two series of videos, I would say that now I believe the climate crisis is much more urgent than I imagine. We are starting to see poor people and the new generations suffer from climate issues, while the people with political powers are not acting at all. It is important to keep in mind that it is now our responsibility to reshape the world that is about to be an environmental-friendly and habitable one. It is also inspiring that Ken points out voting can grant our generation the ability to impact the political world that needs to change its priority towards saving the planet but not ruining it. The older generation may have excused the climate issues as they only see the time delay side of the climate crisis but Ken mentions that the new generation won't have the privilege to escape from climate problems as the time delay is about to turn into a real crisis. Whatever we need to do for the planet has to be done quickly. This may explain why Ken is proposing a radical solution to the current issues of climate. And I personally go along with him as I believe that if the planet is going to be inhabitable, everyone will suffer. So why don't we solve the problem collectively by declaring our priority as addressing the climate crisis? I can barely find an argument to refute it.

I think something more import than the actual urgency of the climate crisis itself, is that we can still change our futures for the better. The time window of what we can do before "Mad Max" becomes a reality is shortening, the conversation of what is happening or what is going to happen should quickly shift into what we can do, both individually and collectively, about the climate crisis. This is where Ken's part of the video explaining some of things we can do, such as voting, have impact because it shifts the conversation into our own hands. I believe this is the way we're going do anything about the current climate crises by making it an active and ongoing process that humans must invest into. Any action that helps is not too small because once we are able to  push back even one millimeter of the boulder that is climate change, it becomes easier to keep it rolling.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with all your comments regarding the urgency of the climate crisis. If we don't act soon and make an impact, our planet with for sure be ruined.  It is clearly up to our generation to restore the planet from all the harm that has been done to it. As for your last question as to why we can't solve the climate crisis by collectively declaring global warming as our top priority, I believe that the issue isn't so simple to solve.

         <br><br>

First of all, as Ken mentioned in the video, a huge portion of the older generations do not believe that the climate crisis is an important concern at all. A part of this may be due to the fact that they won't be around to experience the effects, but a large part of them are also climate change deniers. To make it worse, the older generation also traditionally has a larger impact in the political process simply because they have more time and they vote more than younger generations. To collectively declare climate change as a priority, we need to get the older generations on board, which is a difficult process. 

         <br><br>

However, there is hope for this to be possible. As Ken said, if every person were to talk to their parents and educate them about the climate crisis, we could make great strides to save the earth. In addition, as time goes on, our focus on climate change will be even greater. As the younger generation grows older and begins to have more of a say in politics, we will inevitably turn our attention to the crisis. The question is if that time may be too far into the future to matter.

3 quarters of all CO2 in the atmosphere put in here by past generations! That is a crazy fact. I admire the fact that Ken recognizes his generations faults and the fact that many of them are still oblivious to their awful ways. We need to act now. I completely agree with Ken. We don't have decades to act and make a change. Kens generation continues to make the situation worse and they still don't stop and make a change. We asa  generation do need to take a control of this madness and take real moves to make an actual change. I just do not understand why Climate Change has become such a political issue. Climate change is not politics! Its a fact and its awful. How can we debate the fact that polar ice caps are melting, coastlines are eroding away, temperatures are rising, and so much more. 
         <br><br>
I agree with Ken that we can vote and more importantly, we can get others to vote. I used to find myself in this mindset that voting doesn't matter and my opinion is junk. If our generations simply comes together and starts to vote for a change, we can actually get something done. Ken makes a major point. His generation, the ones who made this mess, will be dead an buried when we are dealing with the worst of their mistakes. That is terrible and honestly very scary. I for one do not like this fact. we must try to take some control to minimize this terrible future we are headed for.
         <br><br>
I appreciate that Ken focused this lecture on our generation and the call for Us to make the change. we cannot rely on the past generations to change their stubborn minds and ways. I like the idea that we need to teach our own parents of what is going on and the consequences of their past actions.
         <br><br>
Ken I just want to say thank you for being so honest and open about the facts of the past. It is encouraging and comforting.

The vague platitude of "just go vote" means little. It is prescribed as a panacea, a way to win everything we want and need, but it means nothing outside of context. Voting is nice, yes, but it is both not enough and is horribly vague. We need more than just voting: we need voting for the right people, along with vastly more action in strikes, organizing, and applying pressure on the levers of power. Talking to our parents isn't enough; voting is not enough. Hell, voting for a candidate that wants to take on climate change isn't enough. We need so much more. 

         <br><br>

The labor movement was not won through voting. The Suffragette movement was not won through voting. Civil rights, Stonewall, the five-day work week, all of it: none of these victories were accomplished through showing up once every two or four years and casting a singular vote. We need movements, we need protests that do far more than just walk in a straight in predetermined line. Sabotage and strikes, genuinely putting pressure on those in control, and all forms of organization are needed if we actually want to change just about anything. We have to do more. 
         <br><br>


This is not to say that voting does not matter. It absolutely, completely matters: the reason I believe this is why I organize, canvass, and phonebank for Bernie Sanders every single week. The simple fact is that we cannot stop there.

After
watching the speech video, I began to doubt myself because I thought I was a
person who was very concerned about environmental protection. I also made some
actions to protect our environment, such as waste sorting, public
transportation, waste water recycling, etc. But after watching this video, I
think my efforts are just a drop in the bucket and have too little influence.
We need more powerful forces to change our environment in more ways, such as
policies, media campaigns and punitive measures. Because what we do will
directly affect ourselves and our future generations.
         <br><br>

Kenmentioned the ranking of the climate crisis in 29 issues. The results are quite
predictable: 23 out of 29 in the 1970s; 18 out of 29 in the 1960s; and 15 out
of 29 in the 1940s and mid-1950s. I don't think it's their fault that the older
generation did not paid so much attention to environmental protection, but
because of the education they received, and the focus of the media and society
in their era .We live in the Internet age, information can be widely spread,
thanks to the way we understand information through the Internet, our
understanding of environmental protection is broader and deeper than the older
generation. So, it is our mission to spread the thought.
         <br><br>

Another interesting topic mentioned in the video is the influence of children on their
parents. As a child of my family, I used to think that we should learn
something from our parents, because they are older and their experience is
richer than mine, so they should know more than I do. But after watching the
video, I found that their knowledge of environmental protection is still
limited, so teenagers have the responsibility to teach their parents and
popularize the knowledge and attitude about climate change.

After the lecture, I thought that the people in power to stop climate change needs to change their views about the impact of climate change.  The new generations have little representation due to older people voting almost twice as much emphasized by Ken in the video.  One note that Ken mentions is the transfer of knowledge from the children to the parents.  I think a lot of college students are involved in political ideas and want to change the world for the better.  Many parents right now did not grow up in the same circumstances as this generation is right now.  They will never get to experience the worst of climate change.  I feel like that is why these topics are more of an interest in many younger people because they will be the ones who will have to live in the future conditions.  Many want to change the world but lack the power to do so.  I think they only way this generation can cause change is by voting and lifestyle changes.  With those being the two ways to cause change some do not even have access to one of those.  Many college students are not able to vote so the only way for them to cause change is to simply just have a more sustainable lifestyle change.  I think that is why a lot of sustainability and vegan lifestyles are more common in people in their 20's.

I am again thoroughly disappointed in the situation that we find ourselves in in this generation. I think voting is a great step and I would urge everyone who can to vote. The thing about voting is that for it to have a positive effect, the majority of people should be in agreement about what it is that they want to change. If the 3 generations above ours see climate change as not even more important than half of the other issues that need to be addressed in this country, then how is a majority meant to overturn that misguided view. We would need almost our entire generation to vote and to vote similarly to shift the culture towards a more economically thinking culture. 
         <br><br>
Unfortunately, not everyone has the education or the perspective or  the desire to do so. And many of my generation feel hopeless in the power of democracy and the current political climate. How are we supposed to overcome that hurdle when some of our generation only care about the pleasures they can get out of menial things like partying or getting laid? This call to action is important, no doubt, but not everyone in our generation shares the motivation after being disappointed time and time again by the failings and selfishness and lack of honour of those in power currently. So as much as I agree that voting is important to enacting collective change, there has to be other things that we individually can do to not exacerbate the culture that is destroying this planet.

I genuinely appreciate Ken’s concern about the climate crisis and his passion for being a scholarly activist. He understands the severity of climate change, and he has spent countless efforts in disseminating this information and calling us to action, not soon, but now. Before taking this class, I knew climate change was an issue but didn’t realize how severe this problem actually was. Ken has helped me realize that we can all influence change if we vote ourselves and convince others to vote as well. Also, we can communicate this information to our parents who may not realize that this is an important issue. Increased communication, especially from younger people, can emphasize the severity of this problem since we are willing to bring it up to our parents when otherwise we might not have cared about voting as much.

         <br><br>

Ken’s remark about the time delay for CO2 is a significant reason why many people do not truly believe in climate change. Over the past 60 years, nearly 75% of carbon gas emissions have been produced, and at an exponential rate too. Older generations haven’t faced the consequences of their actions, so it is necessary for younger generations to not only realize that this is a problem but also understand that we need to take immediate action to fix this. I support Ken’s statements and agree that if we want to save the planet, we need to take control.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the lecture videos, I realize how important our generation is to help mitigate climate crisis and take control of the planet. We need to use our power to change the world from many aspects, like politics, and people’s beliefs about climate change and their lifestyles. What we do will directly impact ourselves and our future generations. It is a big mission, but also very vital and important.
         <br><br>

Ken Hiltner mentions the rank of climate crisis among a total of 29 problems made by groups of generations. The results are quite predictable:70s ranked at 23 out of 29; baby boomers (60s) ranked global warming as 18 out of 29; Gen X (40s and mid-50s) ranked at 15 out of 29. We can notice that the older the people are, the less urgent they feel about climate crisis since they don’t see the severe consequences of climate change a lot due to the time delay. In this case, the young generation is vital to fight with these generations who are in power of politics. The political change and creativity are so important that they directly affect the trend of the climate crisis.
         <br><br>

Another interesting topic mentioned is child-to-parent intergenerational learning. Teenagers have responsibilities to tell and popularize knowledge and attitudes about climate change to their parents. However, some parents are actually doing well in making actions to protect our planet, like my mom. She tries her best to reduce the waste of our family and she has a sense of sorting rubbish. I believe that it is a good step for their generation to participate in mitigating climate change in daily life. 
         <br><br>

I really hope that our generation could play a role in changing the current situation of the climate crisis and mitigating it to minimize the damage of global warming to ourselves and future generation. It is still not late, but the time is NOW.

Our generation is very important, and I strongly support your ideas. We do not only need to save ourselves, but also the younger and older generation. Many of our parents would still be alive by 2050, but if we keep letting climate change demolish the world, not only they cannot survive but we won’t either. Our generation is very crucial to “saving” everyone: including the old and the young. Like you said, the time is NOW for us to make a change.


<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. To be honest, when Ken tells us to take control of the planet, it sounds a little unbelievable and unrealistic to me. I mean I have just turn to an adult last year and basically I am a student. What do you expect me to do in order to be in power?  But as I start to think that my future will suffer if I keep in inaction, I begin to realize that it is my responsibility to ensure myself and my children to have a brighter future. We, the young generation, should start taking actions change the current situation and change the elders’ opinion regarding climate crisis.

         <br><br>

Also, I believe that some baby boomers and older generations have already realized the happening of climate. The reason why they care so less about it is they think that it would affect them too much because by the time severe impacts occur, they might be gone already. This is the time where their children and offspring should take actions. As Ken mentions in the lecture, the young people need to show and teach the elders how the climate change could damage their future. As their realized this point, I believe they are willing to change in order to guarantee their beloved to live happily and healthy in the next decades and centuries.

“What can you as a generation do to undo what my generation has done?” Ken asked us that question because it’s too late for his generation to make a huge impact on this issue that we have. He talked about how our generation might not be able to come into power once his generation leaves, and that really got me thinking. How much power and influence will our generation have upon the people of the world. Are we just going to sit back and watch the world fall apart around us or are we going to be able to rise up and make a change to this catastrophic disaster?
         <br><br>


“You need to take control of this planet.” One of the most truthful statements said that not many people realize that we have and need to do. I think it was important that Ken mentioned the relationship between climate change and the government. I believe that people in power have the biggest influence because they are listened to the most. Citizens listen to these people in power because they are “supposed” to know what is going on in the world and they are “supposed” to tell us what is it we should do to fix or to change our ways to make the world a better place. In the video, Ken mentioned that it is going to be up to our generation to fix the problem and make a change in the way we treat our earth. If we do not succeed in this, then we might as well kiss our backyards, beautiful landscapes, beaches, and forests goodbye.

This question also got me thinking. Even if we take massive social and political moves to gather power, how much change can we really make unless we are the lawmakers? And even if we do promote changes as an age group, to what scale of issues can we address? Recently, bans against plastic straws went viral on social media. Although I have been seeing less plastic straws at restaurants, does this really have an impact in global climate change? Many people online my age are quick to reply to a catchy "don't use straws" message, but how many are focusing on the bigger issues of single use plastics and consumerism. 

         <br><br>

       I agree that currently, our leaders and figureheads, whether its a politician, who we see on the news, or a celebrity, have the most power because they have influence. However, the people hold the keys to that power, especially in our democratic system in the United States. I believe that the only way we can shift who everyday citizens are listening to for direction is through education and radical social movements. If we promote environmental education at all grade levels, we can give people the tools they need to understand the global situation, rather than listening to others. And as Ken said, this information can be passed from child to parent, spreading the awareness and knowledge. Additionally, I think that large scale social movements can have a big impact on those who are not invested in the climate crisis. If people see that their community cares about an issue, they may be more likely to get invested in it as well, or at least have a discussion. I agree that we have to take the power and this can only be done with active effort to change society.

Ken’s videos enforced the idea that the future of the planet is in the hands of the younger generations. He gave statistics showing that the older one is, the less likely they are to take the issue of climate change seriously, yet these older generations are the ones who hold all the political power in the United States. If younger generations such as Generation Z were to vote more, there would be more policies enforcing healthier, more sustainable lifestyles. Policy change is an import piece to slowing down climate change, and the only way that can happen is for younger generations to become more politically involved.

After watching both lecture videos, I did learn a lot about the attitude of older and younger generation toward the climate change. Because of people are not making any progress or adjustment, the professor still think that we could do something to mitigate the crisis. What's more, we have to step put our comfort zone and really do something to make our environment a better place.

I’ve found myself talking to my family, friends, and to basically anyone who will listen to me about what we discuss in ken’s lectures, the articles we read and even share the documentaries we’ve watched. So, when he stated that a thing we could do to help take control of the situation was child to parent intergenerational education, I felt quite content with myself because that’s what I’ve been doing on the nights my parents FaceTime me or I go home to visit. 
         <br><br>

My brother who is currently nine years old, it constantly checking in with me to see if there is any more information that I’ve learned after kens lectures or if I have any videos that I can send him to watch. Although he is pretty young, one is never too young to learn about the future of their planet, it is only fair they know what’s to come so they know not to make the same mistakes. 
         <br><br>

I’m not one who’s into politics because it seems like such an ugly thing. I’m always seeing people argue about what’s right and what’s not or who’s better and what not, but if I can contribute to my generation and help push things into the right direction, then count me in.

I too was specifically struck by this idea of intergenerational education that Ken presents in his lecture. It does seem as if making attempts to have active conversations on the climate crisis within family connections is the simplest yet most effective action that we as college students can take. When I first became interested in studying more about climate change, I was so intrigued by the facts I had learned that I began to share this knowledge, first with friends then with my dad. One of the problems that I have run into, however, is that some family members have been selective about the information they choose to take in, regardless if they are climate “deniers” or not. For example, environmental justice is one such topic that creates much tension in my conversations in the sense that much of my family refuses to believe in the discrepancies of exposure to climate change’s negative environmental impacts. Therefore, I am curious as to how you have dealt with any opposition from family members, especially of previous generations.

In the text, the professor mentioned that our generation needs to take over our planet if we want to improve climate change. I agree with this statement. As the professor mentioned, the previous generation has emitted too many gases that have an impact on the climate like carbon dioxide, which has led to intensified climate change. If our generation wants to change this situation, we must act now. We don't need to participate in politics immediately, we just need to start with small things like drive less cars and go out by bicycle.

         <br><br>

We don't have much time to act. As the professor said, we do n’t have decades or even years, and we must do what we can to change the status quo from now on. As a Chinese, I have to apologize first, because most Chinese people at least have few concerns about environmental issues among the people I know. Most people are more concerned about academic or work issues, and I hope more people will Seeing the impact of the environment and climate change is driving more people to take action.

I feel like an issue on the younger generations not weighing in on the voting aspect is in two parts; one for the fact that their aren't politicians who are running for presidency that are around our age so the younger generations don't feel the obligations to vote for someone they don't feel the on the same plane for (though yes much of the new candidates are looking to the youth for their new power swing, I still feel the generational divide makes a major issue), and two, as for myself, I feel that the youth in the United States is looked more or so down upon and and makes us feel as if we have no power over what is going on in the United States. The country is ran by Ken's own generation and a generation that he views as corrupted by their own greed which is a major issue seeing that many of these politicians take pay outs from major business, such as the Koch brothers, who swing the politicians into being in total denial of what damages they are leaving on the planet due in part for the fact that they are getting paid to transcend the climate crisis into an all out political subject of argument. Now not is all lost, with figures like Alexandria Ocasio Cortes gaining power, it is the right direction of movement towards the younger generation running the nation, but it is one step into the deep dark blue sea we call our government. For instance, when AOC came out with the "Green New Deal" which would have been pivotal towards a greener and renewable United States, it was back lashed crazily by the right, making fun and over exaggerating the stated changes that were implemented into the deal which influenced Americans into seeing this Green New Deal as more of a joke than a solution which is heartbreaking.  The politicization of the climate change has been it's biggest issue as now it is admit the most divided system in the United States, a system that we as a youth, see our own selves having no power over the much corrupted older generations living in denial through the greed that they will take to there grave and let us watch the world burn before us. 

         <br><br>

Now, I digress from my pessimistic point of view, and see optimism in Ken's idea of "inter generational learning", where we can teach our parents and many more from generations behind us about the greater dangers of the climate crisis. I feel that this is the most plausible solution because of the fact that most of those who deny the climate change are believing based on loose base of what they claim as facts, but in reality with the knowledge we gain through this class and the science to back it, it can be an influential power in influencing the past generations who come out to vote more than us, the youth. My grandparents are ones who have become understanding of the climate change through me chatting at their ears about it and through the science that unfolds behind it. We as a youth can take to the streets, spreading the knowledge of the climate crisis and convert many to understand that the direction we are heading in is the path of doom to our planet and what we should do is act now.

In the first lecture, Ken indicated that it’s hard for the generation that caused climate crisis to take action because of political circumstances and lack of strong acceptance on that issue. However, in the second lecture, Ken advocates young generations to get control of the planet since more and more young people pay attention to the climate crisis and its negative consequence than old generations. In my perspective, it is a great suggestion since most of us are going to live a more sustainable lifestyle and everything can be improved in brand new beginnings. For old generations, it is difficult for them to change lifestyle or follow something environmentally friendly. In other words, they are unlikely to advocate their children to save the planet. However, like their children or grandchildren, we own a more advanced mind and educational resources. Our generations are able to pass the idea of a more sustainable lifestyle to next generations. In most universities, student organizations are actively encouraging environmental consciousness on climate change and classes like English 23 are explaining the truth and urgency of the climate crisis. They are all positive preparations for better environmental consciousness and movements in future decades, though past generations still have strong power in politics.

After watching both of the lecture videos posted it really got me thinking of why there are still climate change deniers. I understand that it can be tough to believe something your entire life, seeing this help you flourish I get that, but when the undisputed evidence is right in front of you how can you still deny the facts. I am not talking simply about just statistical data over the course of the past 150 years, but rather what is happening in the present with all of these sporadic natural disasters. It is rather unfortunate that the people in power have quite honestly taken steps backwards in solving this climate crisis, but what does give me hope is that the younger generation has a strong will for saving this planet and these issues will soon begin to be minimized. Ken brought up a valid point about how significant the time delay of the climate crisis has negatively affected the decisions of those in political power right now. I believe if it was not for this delay the planet would be in much better hands right now. Another point I agree with is that as young citizens of this country the most impactful way for us to make a change, besides changing daily life habits, is that we must increase the voter turnout. Not only will it give us the people a stronger voice, but it will assure that we put the correct people in power to help save the planet. The fact that ⅔ of the world's CO2 emission in the atmosphere has been put there in the last 60 years is concerning and does not seem that it is going to end well at all. A change must occur so we can provide a better life for future generations. 


         <br><br>


I just want to take the time to thank Ken for making these videos and being proactive in the fight against the climate crisis. Although, he does explain the severity and the sense of urgency that must be taken into account he also remains optimistic and hopeful in our generation. I find it very encouraging that he believes we will be the generation that turns our planet in the right path. Not only is he telling us something must change, but he is providing us with the information we need in order to make that very change. He continues to talk about the youth movements of today and that he is confident that if this continues we will eventually have a healthy planet. Yes, fossil fuels have advanced our life dramatically, but there comes a point that too much of something never is good.

You are right, a big problem with my generation is that we do not go out and vote as much as we should. Majority of us don’t know when to vote for local state elections and usually just focus on the big presidential one, even though the local government is also very important. Eventually though, as morbid as it may sound, we will take the power through the natural passing of time, will it be too late though? Most likely yes, if we were to wait say 30 years to start enacting climate change policies. Based off everything we’ve learned so far, that would be way too late. And we would not only have to wait for the baby boomers but then gen x right after them. And if we continue on our trend we might get outvoted by the generations below us, but that necessarily is not a bad thing. If we continue climate change education and get rid of deniers then we would be able to accomplish more for the environment since before the industrial revolution.

After watching the two lecture snippets, I was interested how ¾ of the CO2 is put into the atmosphere within my professor lifetime and what are possible actions that I can take to make the world a safer and happier place. It was interesting how the lecture snippet was informing how denying climate change is very popular in this developing world, yet there are a lot of natural disasters occuring for it to be simply neglected. It is sad to say since we are neglecting climate change, andwe are wasting time to make a change and stand up to resolve the solution. I was interested when he took about all the three groups specifically and how each one is all affected by climate change no matter how much they affect it. They are all affected by climate change and risk their chance of survival.The first snippet emphasizes how the older generations are more likely to vote against the younger generations which gains more popularity of vote against climate change and not resolving a lot of the issues.Older people, 75+,  don’t think climate change and ways to stop as a priority as he younger generations do. The older generation have more authority since people involved in the government who have higher positions and are involved in voting. As well, the younger generations aren’t able to vote since they aren’t retired and the political events are usually held during times of work. It  makes them able to have  more say in this kind of topic. As well, since we're not doing nothing to fix the co2 not going to the atmosphere, we are only going to make the percentage increase. The CO2 percentage are already double significantly each year and even more if we don’t don’t do anything to prevent it. I really liked how the video emphasizes how voting is a key factor because being involved politically can actually make a positive factor to decrease the CO2. In addition, the video mentions how violence doesn’t solve anything because it just makes matters worse.

"You need to take control of the planet." Because yes or no, our generation is responsible for what the previous generation and our generation have done to the environment. Our generation needs to take action to make the planet healthy and sustainable, because we are directly responsible for this result(good or bad). If we do not take on this responsibility, when disaster strikes, we may only blame the previous generations in the soil and regret why they did not act. I used to be uninterested in voting because I didn't think this vote was important and it won't change anything, but now I think it's a way of expressing appeal and a way of being responsible to the planet. In everyday life we can reduce emissions to protect the planet, and I think voting is more important. It is our right and duty to vote for the benefit of our generation and to make the living conditions of our generation better.

I agree that voting is more important than the small things we can do personally for the environment.  Much of the power needed to prevent climate change is concentrated in the government.  As regular people, we have no ability to influence how large companies use fossil fuels other than to vote.  Further in the future, as more people from newer generations gain positions in government, we will continue to gain control over climate change policies.  For now, however, our generation must go out and vote for the right people.

Upon watching Ken's two videos, I gained a different perspective on climate crisis. 
         <br><br>
Ken talked about the reason that his generation is not acting on climate crisis being the time delay. These people are also the ones in power right now and their decisions are affecting the majority of people on our planet. f we don't start to take control over climate crisis, the situation will continue to worsen. At the end of his video, Ken said the simple answer to what we can do to mitigate the climate crisis is to fundamentally reinvent the Western culture and be less material. Coming from China, our country is closely related to Western culture. Since we make everything and a big part of our income is from manufacturing what they need, our actions depend Western culture. For example, if all of a sudden Western culture decides yeezy is not trending anymore, many shoe factories making yeezy might go out of business. If the Western culture decides to fundamentally reinvent their  culture to mitigate climate crisis, I think our country will have a lot things to do to follow up their decision. So, for China, I think the equivalent thing as Westerners reinvent the culture is to be independent and self-sufficient economic wise. Climate wise, if we start to only make things that we need plus the fact that Chinese government is willing to act on climate change, I think we will be fine. I guess what I am trying to say is that there is a solution to climate change for every country based on their different conditions and that we all have some thing that we can do to help our planet.

I agree that it is important to point out the differences in the people who have power (aka Baby Boomers) and those that know change needs to happen (Gen X, Gen Z). I think that we have come to a very pivotal point in time in our history and that the young will move up and push out the old, both people and ways of thinking. It is interesting to hear your point of view, as someone from a different country who knows on a more personal and experienced level how it operates. I can see how China and the U.S. are closely linked and when one country decides a certain action, there are ripple effects on the other country. I think you might be right in predicting that there is a large, overall trend between what the U.S. does and China either following or adopting to stay allies or profitable. Hopefully, we see the U.S. make huge strides forward in addressing and combating the climate crisis, and similar steps by China to stay in business, but by moving towards sustainability, if that’s what it takes. Thank you for your perspective!

I mean in all honestly Ken is absolutely right about this issue, it is our generations responsibility and will be the defining issue of our future. Our future will be largely impacted and shaped by the effects of climate change, so I agree that gaining power would be a helpful in infighting change. I do feel like this is far easier said than done, however it would help get policies in place... despite the fact that climate change should not be a political issue overall. I don't think that gaining power will completely solve the issue either because policy making is DIFFICULT and even then that is only the beginning of a far longer process. This is an issue I feel we all need to solve as a united front, its far too large to be solved by only a portion of the population. This means we m must work harder on helping people understand the crisis that we are in. I think child to parent intergenerational teaching is a good start and could make a huge difference.. however that only goes so far. The most important thing to me is changing ideology on consumerism and consumption, which is mentioned in the lecture video. We must scale down our lifestyles and begin to take more accountability by being sustainable, and this begins with teaching young kids not to make the mistakes we have.
         <br><br>

I have hope in my generation, and I think my generation is capable of insane things- and I really think we can make a change if we start considering it more in our daily lives.

While it is extremely frustrating to see that the generations before us have caused such harm to our planet, we cannot place blame on them for taking up those habits, as we would have done the same if we were them. It is just the way our society evolved and grew. Now that our generation knows what is in store for our planet if we keep the same lifestyle habits and culture, we have the responsibility to do something about it. This is our future we are talking about and we have to get past the angry, resentful feelings we have towards previous generations and start using that energy to make a change in the way our society functions for the future. I like what Ken said about intergenerational learning and how our generation, who is currently in school getting educated on climate change, must communicate to older generations that climate change is a real, frightening issue that will affect our lives and the lives of our children immensely. 
          <br><br>
The youth is a very powerful demographic. As seen through the youth rebellions of the 60s, we have the power needed to make real change happen if we really act to make that happen. Dietary changes and lifestyle changes are important, but what really needs to happen is political changes and that is hard to make happen considering the people in power in the US right now. However, with the power of democracy and an increase in young voters, I  truly feel that we can turn things around and get the ball rolling on action to mitigate climate change.

Admittedly, I believe we live a similar lifestyle to those of the past generation in the sense of the Western and consumerism culture that Ken mentioned in the video; however, the difference is that now we can acknowledge the impact of climate change and make a difference with the changes in our lifestyle and power we have through movement. Ken is right about the power of voting in order to support policies and authorities that support action against climate change, and we must do this as a group. Even though there is definitely a generation divide as reflected by the statistics shared by Ken in regards to voter turnout and concern of climate change, we must garner the support from other people, young or old in order to truly finalize a solid resolution. This must be done through being vocal and communicative about the information about causes and consequences of the emissions of carbon into our atmosphere. I believe many are ignorant to this situation as they don’t believe it will immediately affect them or they may be selfish about how they don’t want to alter their lifestyle. However, they must open their eyes to the situation at hand that affects all people of the world. Ken’s discussion has opened my eyes to the power of movements and the youth that I may not have recognized before. Growing up in a family that rarely talked about politics, I never really concerned myself with such things, but I am now beginning to realize the power that we have as a democracy as well. Although, views and values may differ among groups, action against climate change is a general consensus all must reach. As a result, I definitely will be preparing as a voter as it is the first time I will be able to.

I liked a lot when Ken talked about inter-generational education, and thinking about it, that’s exactly what my parents and I have started to do. Now I don’t know about other people’s parents, but mine don’t like feeling like I’m teaching them! Both of my parents are Ken’s generation, except unlike Ken, they certainly didn’t think the climate crisis was as big a deal as it is. They believe in Anthropogenic climate change, but just thought that meant rising water levels. Upon taking this class, whenever my parents and I talk now, I slip in some scary statistics about ppm and I project some imagery of year-round fires and uninhabitable temperatures. They are more receptive to it because they realize they won’t see these effects that I will. 
         <br><br>

As far as our generation taking power, I agree with everything that was said in that we don’t really have time to wait for incumbents to phase out of office, and we must pursue political office, but I would counter that young people can yet make a difference without even taking office. If we can convince constituents (who vote for representatives who don’t believe in climate change) that it’s very real, it’s here and it’ll hurt their children, we can get those politicians to change their minds or get out of office. The college vote is so stupidly low, and it’s now that we must use the rights we are afforded to demonstrate that climate change is the number 1 issue we want solutions for.

Your comment really resonated with me, especially when you mentioned talking with your parents about the effects of climate change. Ken's emphasis on inter-generational relations and education is well placed. I don't believe that most people aged 40+ want to be ignorant of the climate crisis, much less leave behind a broken and destroyed world for their loved ones. In fact, between your anecdote and the countless conversations I've had with my parents and grandparents, I've found this to be true (I've even convinced my 60 year old grandmother to follow along with this class). However, an important aspect of inter-generational relations and education that Ken failed to mention is the relationship that we build with our younger siblings and children. By engraving the fundamentals of the climate crisis into the minds of those who look up to us, we can prove to be better than the generation that we looked up to.
         <br><br>

 I also agree with your affinity for educating constituents instead of phasing out politicians who are complacent with the effects of climate change. Not only is this a more proactive approach, but is consistent with striving for inter-generational education.

I agreed with many of your points in your video. As much as people like to say “take shorter showers” and “recycle more,” the fact is that these tiny changes in the average person’s lifestyle will not mitigate the climate crisis, since the top 100 companies are responsible for 71% of released carbon emissions. The only way to actually stop the horrendous consequences of climate change is by holding those in charge accountable. We as young people have to use our right to vote to make changes. I am definitely guilty for this as well, and have not used the privilege of voting yet. However, with the right knowledge on how to make a change, our generation can use our voices to stop the direction we are headed in. Voting is something most of us take for granted, as in other countries (and in the past), we would not have the right to express our opinions. But now that we know the urgency of the issue, it is our job to educate others and hold those in charge accountable for destroying the planet. I hope throughout this course we get to learn more realistic ways to stop climate crisis, instead of people telling us to turn off the sink while brushing our teeth.

I think the way Ken puts it is very concise and valid: we need to take control. As he goes on to briefly touch upon the ways in which he feels we can take control, however, I again had the feeling of being "stuck", something that I've felt these first two weeks of class. I think "taking control" is a great sentiment, but I think in order for us to actually do so, I'd like some viable everyday actions that I can do in order to be a better human to this planet. I think the section of the video that talks about voting is in theory, a great solution. As much as I want to believe it, however, I just don't know how much voting will actually help. After the Trump campaign rigging elections allegations/proof I just have a hard time trusting that my vote is actually counting. Also, just from what information I currently know about the electoral college system when electing people into office, I think there's intrinsic flaws in the way in which our democracy is set up in the first place. It makes me feel (though this may not be fully true) that my vote doesn't matter. It's quite possible that I'm being overly pessimistic, but it's just what my thoughts drifted to at first. 
         <br><br>


An interesting point that Ken brings up are the youth movements in the 1960s. In order to understand on a deeper level of how to "take control", I think it would be interesting to learn how the youth of the 1960s did this. It would be cool if we could learn more about these movements from which to model ours in this class. I think the collective action with the child to parent inter generational learning is a really good point. I think if you're in a position where you can speak openly with your parents about these sensitive issues, I think you should.  I know I've been able to mention small things to my parents and I've seen effective change from them. 

         <br><br>

To Ken's last point of creating a cultural shift and making it so that we fundamentally reinvent consumer culture of finding happiness in material things, I think this is the key. The only problem is, is that this reframing takes time, and we simply just don't have that luxury anymore. I think many people don't want to change habits until they begin to cause harm or until they receive benefit from it. I think that's something we need to consider moving forward and potentially work around. I definitely don't have answers, but I'd be curious to see if Ken has some insights on this. 

         <br><br>

I'm looking forward to learning a little more background for these weeks to come, so that a little more historical context can give us more information.

You have valid concerns and I feel the exact same. I think part of it is pessimism we’re dealing with though. Voting is essential and actually having someone that cares for the environment is the goal, but there’s always going to be the risk of it just not going the way we need it to for whatever reason. Taking action in this case becomes extremely easier said than done. Not because we don’t want to take action, but because of the older people in our way. Perhaps we aren’t speaking out loud enough, perhaps our votes will really count, perhaps we will be able to vote someone into office that will help us fight against this crisis. All of this was going through my mind because the reality is that, at our age, there is only so much we can actually do. To be less pessimistic about all of it, I like to think “well, if we have to get louder so be it. If I have to tell every single one of my friends to register to vote, so be it.” I think we should focus on working our absolute hardest to tackle this issue regardless.
         <br><br>

I also agree with what you said about reframing. I would think it would take an extremely long time for our society to be able to shift our mindset away from materialistic items because look at how much people enjoy these things. We can definitely make the shift, but it would probably take generations. Especially considering that most of the newer generation will probably be introduced to material things at a younger age.
<br><hr>

I agree with you that “taking control” is the most important sentiment of what we can do for the climate crisis. I found these videos the most stimulating and interesting. Discussing the generational priorities is very important to talk about because it is clearly reflected in the voting habits of generations. I am very glad that Ken emphasized the power imbalance among the generations and how the boomer generation currently holds the majority of power in the world, thus making environmental decisions and continuing the crisis. That is such an important aspect of the crisis and why nothing is changing and getting done. The power of voting is something I was very happy to see Ken discuss because to me that is the easiest way to enact change in our current system; by voting for candidates who prioritize the environment and act to change it like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Politics has such a huge influence on the environment and due to the polarizing political climate America is in, climate change has become a left-right issue to be debated and fought over amongst candidates. It is the most important issue of our time that needs to be met with bipartisan agreement and support, not up for debate. People need to be able to be educated about the candidates running so they can make informed decisions and truly bring power to the polls. Voting for candidates that care about climate change is one of the easiest and most impactful ways to take action on the climate change. I think an immediate goal should be to have higher voter turnout amongst young people; that is how we regain control and can put climate change on the forefront of American issues. Overall I found these videos very important as politics play a huge role in how we handle environmental policy and we all have a very active role in that through voting. Everyone that can vote should be voting in this upcoming election as the consequences of voting for candidates that are climate change deniers are going to be dire.

In this video, I clearly noticed that although climate change is a significant problem in our daily life, there are still a large number of people, especially the old generation, who do not hold the opinion that it is serious and need to be solved right now. However, the old generation is a large part of the population in the United States, which means that the decisions are much more influenced by them, instead of the young generation. The old generation always focuses on how to develop the country at a much faster speed and few of them consider the consequence of using superfluous resources, which produces a large amount of pollution to the world. Taking an example that happened in my life, I had a discussion about climate change with my parents a few years ago. I strongly rebuked the overuse of the natural resources that let my generation need to clear up the mess that was left by the old generation. However, my parents just said that they did this is all for giving us a better future life. Also, a lot of old generations hold the opinion that why there are so many teenagers and young generations focus on climate change is because they are idle and have nothing to do so they stand out to appeal to people to focus on this problem. To be honest, I do not think that educating our parents and families is a good way to solve this problem. However, it does not mean that we do not need to learn how to educate our families. Our young generation also has a day that will become the parent of a child. It is useful to teach the next generation about how serious this problem is. To learn how to solve it and learn the importance of solving this problem in our generation will let the problem begin to be solved and to teach the next generation about it will let this problem can be continued solved in the future.

I understand that these were meant to be motivational videos, yet I must admit they left me feeling quite hopeless.  I felt like a little kid feels when they realize that they cannot make their own decisions, and their parents essentially dictate their life.  The older generations not only left us a giant mess to clean up for them, but is continuing to refuse to help us fix it in any way.  I do feel as though much of the older generation still looks down upon the younger generations as immature and naive, and that likely affects this a lot. I was aware that the Millenial and GenZ generations need to increase their voting rates, and I was aware of course that many of the politicians in office are of older age.  However, I did not put together in my head how that is directly affecting things like the climate crisis.  We not only need younger votes, but we also need many more young people to take positions in office.  

         <br><br>

For me, these lectures just enhanced the lack of power that I, as a single individual hold to make a difference.  Ken suggests that our generations need to take control of the earth, but I feel like we are left in a position that makes this near impossible.  I know that in coming years, as more of GenZ reaches voting age, and as more of the Millenial population reaches an age to where they can run for office and be taken seriously, we will begin to see change for sure.  However, I wonder if this will be too late, if we will not be able to take enough action soon enough.  While I do strongly agree that our generation needs to step up and work towards making the changes that we are able to, a large amount of power still lies in the hands of the older generations, which leaves me scared.  Are enough of them going to act on the danger which they created?

While I understand why you may feel hopeless, I think we as a generation can start making change now. The voter turnout for elections, including local and national level elections, is still lower than it could be. And as mentioned in the video, voter turnout of young voters is even lower. We saw in the 2018 midterm elections, which had the highest voter turnout in midterm elections since 1914, that change is possible. We saw the election of Ocasio-Cortez and other younger or democratic party representatives into the House of Representatives, turning it into a Democrat majority. Change is possible.
         <br><br>
However, it is still extremely difficult. People, including college students live busy lives, and along with voter apathy and other factors can easily decide not to vote. Personally, I am not too optimistic about changing voter turnout in favor of climate change but know that it is possible. Changes should be made to make voting easier. Some popular examples include a more streamlined registration process, creating an election day holiday, and increasing access to education. I may be a bit hypocritical, as I am saying all these things about voting, but I am not too involved with politics and am doing nothing to influence other people to vote. From now on, I will not only continue casting my own vote in elections, but also try to influence at least a couple other people around me to vote as well.
<br><hr>
I feel your hopelessness. It is hard to accept this as the hard truth that we have to deal with, even though we just got here. I have a very hard time not being angry. Like, so angry I just want to go crazy and protest and destroy everything that lies between our generation and fixing this issue. It's important to acknowledge your feelings about the issue, but then we must act. The last generation did not act because of their feelings, and we must do what we can do prevent extinction or no one else will. Even if it is hopeless, we have no choice but to try. It isn't something that can or will be done by individual action, and thats the most powerful part of this lecture to me. We must work together with our generation, elect leaders who will put pressure on fossil fuel industries, make them feel the heat they've created. We will have the biggest youth movement of all time, and we need everybody on board. I know our generation has always dreamed about being hippies like in the '60s and '70s, and here is our chance! 
         <br><br>
It's easy to see everything that is going terribly, it is almost impossible not to. We must also acknowledge the change we have made. General knowledge about climate change is at an all-time high. Voter turnouts for the 2018 midterm elections were absolutely historic for our age group. People like AOC in office, who are unapologetically holding policy makers and CEOs accountable, and pushing infrastructure for the Green New Deal, are proof of what we can and will do. It is so hard not to feel hopeless, but also so important. We have to try. We have no other choice.
<br><hr>

I 100% agree, we have no option but to try. We have to work hard and make our impacts as much as we can.  I know that I for one, often in social media and in person attempt to motivate the people of my generation to vote.  I have noticed things for example on campus simply along the walkway by the library where there are all kinds of petitions and voter registration stands and I think that those can be really powerful as well.  However, I think that our generation is realistically not enough.  This is where my fear lies, and I think we really need to find a way to influence the views and perspectives of the older generations because we need their votes also.
<br><hr>
Change is possible, and it does begin with the individual.  I think your last statement is very important, I appreciate the way in which you have decided to make a personal change within your own life because I think that is the most important thing, and if everyone was to follow in suit, we would begin to see a difference.  However, as I stated above, it feels as though the impact of the younger generations is realistically not sufficient, and I am curious to hear more about the intragenerational impacts we may be able to make as Ken mentioned throughout the video.  We need older generations to make a true impact as well.

First of all, I love and appreciate Ken for what he's doing. Thanks for having faith in our generation.
         <br><br>

Second of all, I'm very excited for our generation to take control! What got me excited was the clear potential; the fact that 2/3 of us still aren't voting is worrisome, but it's a problem with an easy solution -- increase our voter turnout. While we cannot impeach all the boomers in political office right now (though for one of them, that's an exciting possibility) nor easily instate younger CEO's in fossil fuel companies, we CAN get more of us voting. Especially when our generation is presented with the reality of our future, such as through taking a course like this, increasing voter turnout shouldn't be a problem. It never struck me that boomers are in power not just because they hold high office, but because they vote much more than we do! 
         <br><br>

The child-to-parent communication idea appears to be a very effective idea as well. As scary as it can be to present radical solutions to our older parents, at the least, their children's engagement in politics can be a clear indicator of the severity of the crisis. If we all began to have these open conversations with our parents, it may be a very effective way to shift their vote in a way that doesn't have severe consequences for their children's futures.

I totally agree with you. It's uplifting and inspiring to hear people from the older generations like Ken, as well as Bernie Sanders, having faith in our generation and in our ability to bring about change. I agree that increasing voter turnout among people our age is the way to go, but I disagree when you say that it's an easy one.  I know so many of my own friends and peers who honestly couldn't be less bothered with politics and would probably view going out to vote as an inconvenience. Interestingly enough, I think that Donald Trump and his administration is going to be the biggest catalyst that helps drive voter turnout in Generation Z and Millenials this upcoming election. With the current administration being wildly unpopular with the youth of America, one of the reasons for the results of the 2018 midterm elections, I have high hopes for the upcoming 2020 presidential election. I firmly believe that dissatisfaction with the Trump administration is going to bring out record numbers of people like you and me to vote for the future of our nation. Still, I think that we shouldn’t view the issue of turnout in our generation as having an easy solution; probably one of the most effective things we can do is seriously urge our friends and peers to get out and vote, after making informed decisions! 
<br><br>
I hear Ken’s plea for us to take matters into our own hands and take control of the planet. I agree with him when he says that this is truly the most effective way for us to make sure that something is done about the climate catastrophe facing our world. As we have seen in this class, the people in power today have time and time again failed humanity, by failing to take the necessary steps to prevent or mitigate climate change. After decades of letting them have their way, continuing the status quo and getting rich off of exploiting the planet’s resources at the detriment of the environment, I think that a lot of people my age would agree that enough is enough. It is finally time to stand up to those at the top who refuse to change their ways, and start taking matters into our own hands to prevent total and utter devastation in the wake of the climate crisis.
<br><hr>

Ken is indeed doing a great job of being a role model for the younger generation. I, too, was thrilled when I heard Ken talking about possible solutions because it lays out the steps that we need to collectively take in order to turn this planet around. Apparently, the only ⅓ of the younger generation voted while ⅔ of the younger generation voted. This is worrisome because the older generation has shown that they do not care about the climate. Ken stated that we need to change now and take ahold of the planet, and this will not be possible if the older generation is voting two times as much as the younger generation. I also agree that talking to your parents about climate change is not easy. I know that many parents are very stubborn and usually refuse to change their ways. However, we owe it to ourselves and future generations to do everything that we can to help save this planet.


<br><hr>

I agree with you that climate change has come to a generational, political issue. While young people are increasingly aware of the severity of our climate crisis, they still have a long way to go in terms of gaining political clout and transforming to a more human-friendly and environment-friendly economy; if boomers continue to represent the majority in politics and cold-hearted capitalism, we will never be able to pass the bills we need, nor drive our movements with effective forces. Although it is easy to be pessimistic as our politics are becoming more polarizing and divisive by the day, it might also wake people (especially young voters) up to encourage better participation. In fact, just recently, the 2020 presidential elections in Taiwan saw a record number of votes, thanks to young people telling each other to join the political conversation and exercise the vote as a fundamental right.
<br><br>

I believe in Ken's message, which states that "we should take control of our planet" by initiating imminent global action and implementing changes not in a few decades or few years, but right NOW. This echos what Ken has taught us in the lecture: even though these ideas may seem radical and alarmist, we really don't have many options to salvage this planet from a catastrophe.

<br><hr>

I completely agree. I find this set of videos really motivating and inspiring because, alongside sharing information and statistics about the climate crisis, we were given a couple of really concrete ways to save our future. 
<br><br>
While Ken presented voting and child to parent inter-generational communication as two separate entities, I think they really go hand in hand. While some parents/people have a hard time believing what their children are telling them, i think them seeing how our generation votes in the upcoming elections will be the most effective form of inter-generational communication. If we vote in masses and make sure to support legislature like the Green New Deal and support candidates that have clear plans for solving/mitigating the climate crisis, the older generation will have no choice but to acknowledge our beliefs, which may cause them to reconsider their own. I think if anything, us standing in solidarity with the earth and voting to protect it through legislation, laws, and standing/donating/standing alongside politicians/activists who know that the climate crisis is a real issue will make a massive difference. Voting out corrupt politicians, protesting against corrupt CEO's,  and showing our support to foundations/activist/political groups that have our earth's future in mind will send a clear message, and I believe that we can do it, especially because of classes like this that teach us what we're fighting to stop, and what we're working to save.
<br><hr>
I also want to say I really appreciate Ken for his efforts! As well as for having faith in our generation. I am also excited for what this crisis can do to bring young people together. I think we can totally increase youth voter turn out, and that such a thing can easily put pressure on the government to take the climate crisis seriously. 
<br><br>
I also think that the child-to-parent communication idea is good. I know for a fact that both my brother and I– two environmental studies students– have improved upon our parents habits. Although they seem steadfast on their KETO diet of so. much. meat. (Gross, I know. But the other day, they were talking about looking into a more plant based diet, exciting!) I think that having frequent discussions with them about their environmentally detrimental diet has really gotten them to think about it. If my brother and I hadn't taken it upon ourselves to try and make them realize that their habits are unsustainable, they would never have started to consider changing their lifestyles.
<br><hr>
I agree. I think it is very exciting that our generation is the one that may slow the climate crisis. As Ken explained, our generation "grasps the enormity of this crisis." Because our generation understands the severity, we are the ones that need to act. Now. It is up to our generation to save the world, which is a colossal task. However, it is worrisome that two thirds of us aren't voting. We must increase voter turnout in order to help the world shift politically, because after all, political change is "of central importance." It is true that this political shift cannot happen overnight, but we need to speed the process as much as we can. This will stem from voting. I can understand why there are people constantly approaching me, asking if I am registered to vote, when I walk near the library. 
<br><br>

The idea of "child to parent intergenerational learning" took me by surprise, but is brilliant. Just today I urged my parents to cut beef out of their diets, and I was delighted to hear that they already did. I agree that our engagement will portray the severity, because from what I've experienced, boomers tend to think our generation doesn't care about a lot of things. If and when we show that we care, I believe that they will start to, also. I think that we need to keep reminding them that the climate crisis will not only effect us, but their grandkids, and generations to come of their descendants. Hammering in this fact I believe will serve as a reality check. It is no longer about them anymore. It is about us, their children, and I hope that is enough for them to shift their views.
<br><hr>
I too appreciate Ken's belief in our generation. Growing up, and still until just recently, I always felt like my vote didn't matter and I think a lot of that came from how the older people in my life thought about my generation and pretty much any generation but their own. I also, for the first time in awhile, got excited about the options we have in order to address the climate crisis. Actual ideas that are doable and realistic-something like voting has become such a simple thing to do and we must educate ourselves and the people around us to do the same. I hope during the next midterm elections along with the presidential election next year, my generation will overwhelm the voting polls- we have the numbers as Ken states, we just need to DO IT

<br><hr>
I agree, I think it’s amazing what Ken is doing. It’s great he also knows and admits that his generation made this world so bad. Now it is time for our generation to do something. It is kind of scary how many people aren’t voting and if we increase voter turnout that can make a huge difference. The child-to-parent method is very effective. I have told my parents facts and statistics about climate change and it definitely opened there eyes more. They had no idea how much the world was suffering because like most people aren’t paying attention. The quote that ken said “since my generation didn’t do it, this falls on you” is very impactful. It’s so true though, from this class we can see what is happening to this world and it’s our time to change that for our future generations. Our future kids, grandkids, great grand kids.
<br><hr>
Ken is awesome and we love him! Now, I think what you are saying is completely true - we can't get rid of all the boomers in office, it would be a contradiction to democracy and frankly just impossible. While increasing our generation's voter turnout will definitely have an impact and is completely necessary in order for us to make any sort of change, I am not entirely convinced this strategy alone will provide enough political change to be meaningful. Even if we increase our voter turnout from 1/3 to 2/3, the reality is that our generation isn’t in control. As Ken was saying, the vast majority of people in office are in their 60s or higher. Ken, if we can not convince the people who are in charge of our electoral vote that change needs to happen, then will we really be in control? If the majority of congress doesn't believe in climate change and is going to reject the Green New Deal, then what will change? I acknowledge that I am being extremely pessimistic here, but based off the way the political system works, it's hard to truly believe that our country will change. I am not saying that because of this -- that we are hopeless and should just continue to pollute the planet until our entire species becomes extinct. Despite all of this, I do believe in our generation. I believe that there are people who want to help but don't know how to, or don't think they will make an impact. I believe these people are out there and that by educating them -- like you said, classes like this one -- they will change. As for reinventing western consumer culture like Ken said, I completely agree that it must be done for the good of the future generations. We must change our attitudes and actively choose to live sustainably. Even if we can't convince the entirety of the older generations, I do think that the strategy of intergenerational learning is a valuable method that could definitely change some minds. Ultimately, we can only change our own lifestyles and hope that the love between family and friends will be enough for them to change theirs.
<br><hr>
My dad is one of the people that professor mentioned at the beginning of the video: people don’t believe what the scientists say and never consider climate change as a severe issue. I can understand how people like my dad view the climate issue; most of them don’t think they got affected by the climate changes taking place every year, and they don’t have a clear idea of the consequences through their generation is the one who caused the environmental issues we are facing today. I know there are many people in that generation do care about our environment, just like our professor. However, their voice is too small to be heard by the authorities. I’m very disappointed to see the Trump government quit the Paris Accord because this will create no benefit for us as human beings as a whole.

<br><hr>

I'm honestly so humored and thrilled by the exuberance you display in your comment, as it it's clear there are many who are so totally on board with taking control and using our education and passion for this topic to attempt to preserve our planet. I know that I personally was always a skeptic towards personal action. I only ever believed that a true change could happen if the people in power were the ones to change. While obviously that would be of use, it's clear the politicians and fossil fuel companies aren't planning on budging any time soon. If I remained with this "what-can-you-do" mindset, then there IS no chance we can change. But after hearing Ken's explanation, personal action really is the only thing that will make the difference. The youth are the ones who need to alter the power balance, and clearly some already are. I mean, just look at Greta Thunberg, and she's only seventeen, already taking the world with strife. It's clear that we are capable of making a change, it's just a matter of actually putting forth the effort.
<br><hr>
Not only do I also appreciate what Ken is doing and having faith in our generation, but I also appreciate the fact that he continues to apologize and takes full responsibility for his generation. With the whole voting situation, I believe many individuals do not vote simply because they do not look into how much voting can do for our country, as well as our environment. Due to our generation and younger generations being the future, voting is extremely crucial for the country and the environment. I agree that our generation is slacking in voting and that due to many negative factors (to us) occurring in office is due to the fact that the older generations having a larger number of individuals who are actually taking the time to vote. We must take initiative and vote for a better future in our world and in our environment. We must act now, whether it is voting or the child-to-parent communication idea, we must act fast to seek a better and brighter future for not only our generation, but the future generations following us!

Ken is definitely an inspiring professor. He admits and apologies for his generations mistakes. Unlike most boomers he is not in denial about the climate crisis and is encouraging us to create change. Although most positions of power are currently held by people who are ages 60+ I do believe that if our voter turnout increases we can make some changes in regards to who holds these positions which can lead to great change. Eventually these positions will be filled by people our age who are hopefully not in denial about the climate crisis but who knows if by then it'll be too late? It's scary to think about the fact that if we don't act now by the time we 60+ it might be too late. All of the statistics mentioned in the video were very surprising to me as social media painted this pretty picture in my mind in regards to our generation being "woke" for voting and caring about the environment. With that being said I think a majority of our generation does acknowledge the climate crisis with a retweet on twitter but doesn't take action in real life by going out to vote or changing something in their everyday luxurious lifestyle. However I do believe that after having Donald Trump as a president our voter turnout will increase, hopefully.

<br><hr>

I agree that voting and telling your friends to vote would be very effective in increasing our generation's voter turnout. I also think that it was a great idea to recommend us to speak with our parents about the severity of the effects climate change is having now and will have in the future. That being said, I'm still feeling pretty pessimistic about this whole thing. I guess I just don't have enough faith in humanity. I feel like most people won't care enough about the issue until it's too late.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that although the fact that 2/3 of the younger generations aren't voting is worrisome, it isn't completely hopeless. I really like that Ken referenced to the youths rebellions in the 60s and how that has brought about institutional change in terms of civil rights and many more. If it has been done before, it can be done again by our generation.
<br><br>

The child-to-parent communication is a simple but effective approach. I like that it's something that's very personal and small scale, doesn't require new fancy technology, but that if everyone is educated on the matter and started doing it in their own home, we can bring about real change. I remember my junior year of high school, after finding out how bad the meat industry is for the environment, although I was not yet ready to give up meat entirely, I wanted to try and eat as much plant based as possible. So whenever I'm with my parents, I would suggest we go out to vegan restaurants in Vietnam, or I would learn how to make a dish and let them try, and in a way, I think I've influenced my parents in the smallest way by showing them that going meatless once in a while isn't all that bad!

<br><hr>
Yeah, it is absolutely exciting and dope to see more and more Millennials and Gen Z transitioning into positions of power and their increasing participation in politics, particularly our marginalized/minority peeps. There will be much opposition from Boomers in high positions because again change is difficult and generational divides, but I believe it is possible. We see this through the U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Abdullahi Omar impacting politics and involvement in combating climate change. Even the more overlooked parts of us that involve you by simply participating and getting involved in this four year institution because your participation impacts academia. In a way, you also have a responsibility to enforce and pass on what you’ve learned in college; we forget that attending college is a privilege. Which leads into a point I think Ken may have missed; a good way to impact climate change is through education. The more we make knowledge available to everyone the more we incorporate a wider audience into the climate crisis discussion and de-stigmatize the issue (A good way is through films like Fire in Paradise and really all the open source resources Ken has provided us).
<br><br>
On a side note: Okay I get that older generations will most likely do nothing against climate change but simply suggesting it is up to younger generations to fix the issues seems like giving older generations a sort of “pass” or a reason to continue their ways because “the kids will fix it”. Though I understand what  Ken is trying to say and propose, younger generations should not wait on older generations to begin or do anything that we could potentially start today,  this still does not mean we should not hold older generations accountable for their current choices and actions. They should contribute to the cause just as much as the baby Zoomers.
<br><hr>

Like everyone in this comment section, I second to your comment post, I admire Professor Hiltner for having faith in our generation and apologizing for what his own generation has done to our planet. Like you, I find this movement of taking control of climate change to be "exhilarating" like Hiltner mentioned. Although, the idea of increasing voter turnout is definitely an effective move to take control of politics or have an impact to the decision making of our legislation. The only downfall I see with the idea, is that this may take a long time to solidify as our generation is still currently developing. Likewise, It never struck to me also that the boomers are in power, simply because they been around for quite awhile and thus, have more experience in voting than we do, but that doesn't limit the potential of our generation to solve the climate change issue, as long as we work together and thus, start shifting and focusing all our energy towards this issue. We may think that we as an individual do not matter to the planet, but we actually do, small things matter. With that being said, I think a simple shift to our personal hobbies will solve a huge chunk of climate change. For instance, I believe, instead of focusing our energy in building more sport venue that usually leads to deforestation, all for the sake of us being entertain, we need to minimize that and promote planting of trees more.
<br><hr>
I am excited, too! I can be very pessimistic when it comes to social change but our generation is inspiring and I actually have faith in us. As much as we blame boomers, it is also important that we pull ourselves together, otherwise we will be just as much to blame. We have to act on what we preach and blame on the boomers and get started through rebellion, disregarding prohibiting concerns. Baby boomers are in power but WE have the power to sway the public to get the baby boomers to make decisions that concern our future, even if it isn't THEIR future. 
<br><br>


Child-to-parent communication is one of the first places we can alter views. We might not think that our parents will listen to us but, for a matter of fact, parents can be inspired by the youth. I have definitely changed the way my parents think about certain issues that I talk passionately about. It brings joy to my parents that I am learning more about the world and want to change it, even if their views tend to be more traditional than mine.

<br><hr>
I agree that we should all be appreciating Ken and be grateful for what he is doing. It’s good that he has faith in us, but to be honest he has no other choice. We are the last generation that can really do something about this, and Ken is doing the right thing by motivating us and giving us the information we need. 
<br><br>

I am excited for our generation to be in control as well, but it is also very frightening because all of the pressure is on us. It's as if the older generation played a football game and let us get onto the field in the last quarter while we’re losing by 30 points. It is a very tough task, but I hope that we can pull through. As you mentioned, we must begin to increase the number of voters of our generation. I also agree that the child-to-parent communication idea appears to be really effective. I don’t know much about the climate crisis yet, but I'm sure I know more than my parents. Therefore, I believe talking to them about this issue and informing them about it is really important.

<br><hr>

I share the same feeling with you that we can take control of the world in our generation! And I was thinking about how hard we are going to solve the problem, but it turns out that it is very simple to affect people! I will be telling my parents about the disaster like the fire we had in the last quarter and the consequences with them. I am very positive about what will the world be like in the recent future!

We are the glorious generation with heavy responsibility to save our planet. Our elders caused these climate disasters. But because of the time delay, they could not feel the changes clearly, so they denied the severity of climate issues. However, the time delay is much shorter now. In this age, we are able to observe the changes. When I was young, I often went to my grandparents’ house in the countryside. I remembered there were rivers, trees, and piles of mud houses. Ten years later, the condition of the countryside totally changed. Many small rivers went away, and rubbish lying in dry watercourse. When my parents saw the scenes, they showed nostalgia for their childhood environment. They at least had the beautiful memory. However, many infants born in the village do not have the choice. What the elders left them are the drought and dirt. As these poor infants, animals and plants are also innocent but suffer a lot. News about polar bears and penguins losing their habitat is not uncommon. We need to start from just now. What can we do to create a bright future? Ken mentioned about the Intergeneration teaching. This is very interesting and I agree. Like the older generations in USA, my grandparents and parents do not consider climate crisis as a priority. They pay more attention to the chores in life. If we are able to wake up their consciousness and attention to this field, we have more power to protect our planet.

I agree we must vote to make a significant change. For our future, we must seek roles in office and local government. It is evident that the generation of the age of 40 and up don't want to do it and don't feel they need to because they won't need to pay the consequences. They don't have skin in the game because they would live as long.  
<br><br>

I feel lucky that I get to live in a community where the infrastructure is aimed at public transportation and biking. In many other cities such as my home town, for example, it is dangerous to ride a bike, and all resources are vast and spread out. It would not be possible to give up an automobile. My question is, Is it beneficial to change the infrastructure of entire communities towards this was of transportation or will new technology provide similar benefits(electric cars).

I completely agree with your statement. The older generations could care less about the climate crisis and many are still denying it even exists. What’s worrying about this as well is that their voter turnout Is higher than our generation. Voting is a first step in solving this issue as those in charge right now are ignoring the crisis we’re currently living. They feel like they won’t feel the consequences since they’re on their way out of the planet. If we delay the climate crisis even more it will directly affect our generation and the next one. At this point it is pretty much impossible to get these older generations to understand what is at stake here, as the only thing that’ll get them to change is seeing the effects first hand. This is why we need to act and participate instead to avoid that happening.

In this video, professor Ken mainly introduces the reason why the generation that caused climate change is not acting towards solving it and encourages our generation to act immediately. The part that shocked most in this video is the data that carbon dioxide emissions have already exceeded what has been agreed in the Paris Agreement with 3.4 percent increased. It just seemed that what has been studied and suggested are not impacting the actual world. I believe a lot of people who concern about climate change issues will have a sense of helplessness about this data, and there are Fossil Fuel interest industries try to use millions of dollars to compress their voices. This is not an optimal situation.
<br><br>

I think it is smart and interesting that professor Ken mentioned that minority groups, such as the LGBT group, used rebellions to increase political power. His mentioning of this may notice more people that we have been fighting for our political rights, and since the environmental problem is not only a global issue but also a political issue we can advocate the priority and the importance of environmental protection with our rights. Advocating for LGBT’s equality is fighting for people’s rights to love. Advocating for Earth’s protection is also fighting for people’s rights to love, the right to love the animals, the right to love our mother Earth, the right to love the people who live in it by protecting it. These two events have a major theme, love. No one should use money or any methods to stop or cut people’s right to love, so come and love, love the environment, love the earth. Thank you, professor, for noticing us that.

In the video, Ken mentioned that there is a time delay after CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. Therefore, people can not notice the change in climate immediately. That is the reason why the older generation does not regard climate change as a serious problem. There is one point should be noted that three-quarter of CO2 is emitted in 60 years. He also pointed out that there are three groups that are innocent. The first group is people who live in poor countries, because most of the CO2 is emitted by advanced countries. The second group is animals which do not contribute to climate change at all. The last group is the young generation which will suffer the severe consequences of climate change.
  <br><br>
   Climate change is influencing our normal life now, and people should take action to mitigate it. Ken also highlighted that there are some radical solutions to solve the problem. Making more people from the young generation to participate in the election of the president can effectively solve the problem by choosing the president who is concerned about climate change and willing to employ some policies to mitigate it. Furthermore, there should be more and more people aware of the seriousness of climate change. As Ken said, public opinions will have impacts on policymaking. Thus, the more people make efforts to solve the problem, the more likely climate change will be counteracted.

I completely agree with you in the discrepancy between our actions and the time delay that stems from them. Because of it, like Ken said, it is difficult for those of generations to understand the gravity of the situation.  In theory, it should be the opposite, because those of the generation before us have truly seen a difference in the world during their lifetime, in contrast to our generation who was born into it.  I agree with Ken then, much like you do, in that our generation needs to be a force of action in any way they can: talking with our parents, voting more in elections, making our voices heard.  Those in power and wealth are the very influential as a support in the fight against climate change, but in order to catch their attention we have to make an effort, even if it is radical.
   <br><br>

As Ken said (and you mentioned) about the three groups, I wish that more people would see how many innocent people and animals will suffer unnecessarily should big changes to our lifestyle be made. I have found that talking about making a change, unfortunately, is much easier than actually making them.  After self-diagnosing this hypocrisy, I recently have decided to cut beef out of my diet to minimize my carbon footprint. Of course, that is not the only change that makes a difference.  As you said, this is all about a ripple effect like the one Ken described, revolutionary enough to save us and our planet, but it needs to happen as soon as possible.

People often feel desperate and think that individuals can't have enough influence on major events like climate change. But if everyone makes a change in behavior, the behavior of billions of people will bring decisive change: nearly two-thirds of global global greenhouse gas emissions are directly or indirectly related to human consumption. Regardless of the headline, even the most conservative estimates suggest that 
   <br><br>
If we can change our behavior and reduce the consumption of natural resources, we can make a huge contribution to reducing global emissions. But achieving this is a daunting challenge. This requires individuals, families and society to find innovative ways to change the entrenched ways of production and consumption in our daily lives. The climate change mitigation movement will rely on solutions such as: broad global policy reforms, compensation and economic incentives that can affect the industry, and information-based communication. These are undoubtedly important components of international action to stop global warming, but we know that human nature is far more complicated than these solutions presuppose. Human beings are social animals by nature, and "selfishness" is more complicated than previously thought. Under the right conditions, we can cooperate very well, seek reciprocity, and act in accordance with social rules. We also learned that our decision-making process was largely influenced by the circumstances and the choices before us. To make people change, we need to use emotional factors, social incentives, and choice structures to design innovative solutions that work for them, just like we do economically and policy.

After I watched both of Ken's lecture videos, I strongly agree with what he has said in the video. The older generations, known as the baby Boomer, should be responsible for the damage they have done to our planet. As you mention in the video, the so-called baby Boomer still taking an influential role in society, but the sad thing is most of the older generation do not believe climate change is an issue. They have contributed 1/3 of the global carbon emission. It's undeniably true that the future generation will eventually suffer from the fault done by the ancestors. Everybody should live in an environment-friendly lifestyle so that we can slow down climate destruction.

<p>
Upon listening to both lectures provided by Ken, I could feel the gears turning in my head. Though actions such as moving towards electric cars, eating less meat, and all other climate-oriented actions will have an impact on lessening CO2 in our atmosphere, it is the action within the political field that is most important. I had not realized this before watching both these lectures. I was aware that political change was important, but I am now understanding that it is the MOST important form of action. However, it makes quite a lot of sense. The reason we are still not seeing improvement in regards to changing or CO2 emissions is because of our political landscape. Many of those in office are from Ken's generation, and are still in denial due to a: being financially supported by major fossil fuel companies or b: simply don't want to accept the consequences of their actions. This needs to change. 
   <br><br>

But, I find myself wondering how I can make a political difference when our government is filled with so many people against climate change (as I suspect many other students were too). This is where I found Ken's second lecture on the generational issue most impactful. These actions do not have to be on a national level. It starts with your local government. I am now planning on being incredibly active in our local elections, perhaps even meeting with politicians or going to places they are speaking and directly asking them questions about what they can do for Santa Barbara in regards to our ever increasing climate-related issues. If many local government officials start acting, this can eventually impact larger areas of government. I am realizing we have to begin small; local. These videos urged me to do more than what I was already doing, and I want to utilize this comment as a platform to urge other students to do the same. We have all watched the lectures. We have all seen the impacts of climate change. Now, it is up to us to stop it before it is too late.

After reading some of the comments it was interesting to see how many others had the same feeling of wanting to do something while watching these videos on our computers and then taking a step back and looking at the monstrosity of the politics of climate change. Honestly, politics are intimidating. I hate confrontation and I don't like arguing with people. But, like you said, the actions that we NEED to be taking do not have to start with spearheading a national climate action campaign - we need people to be participating in local planning and supporting people in power that will fight for us. Your call to action at the end is perfectly true and gives me a little more hope in that the outcome of this class will result in a whole lot more student activists more involved and aware of the decisions being made around them. Get comfortable enough with the information presented so that you are able to have those  uncomfortable conversations. For 2020 especially, start educating yourself early so that when November comes around you know who you support.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comments on how individual actions have little impact without a change in policy. It is incredibly discouraging that 2/3 of our generation did not participate in the last election. Change is not going to happen unless people vote, and people are not going to vote for politicians who want to limit our carbon use unless they see the danger that carbon posed on our climate. Part of me sees an brighter future, where we see a new administration in the white house taxing carbon, giving incentives to going green, and truly making the U.S. a sustainable country, but another part of me thinks that Trump will most certainly get re-elected if only 1/3 of young people are going to vote. It is sad that climate change is even a political issue, when it is indisputable science. Anthropogenic climate change is undeniably real, we are emitting an alarming level of CO2. To deny this fact is to deny that climate related disasters have increased significantly within the last 10 years.
   <br><br>


I think you propose an optimistic solution to this issue. Maybe we do not make much of a difference at a national level, but making changes at the local level is definitely a step in the right direction.

After watching these two lectures, I understand the mission for changing the climate situation is now mine. It falls to us from the early generation. As a young generation, it's now my responsibility to teach my parents, even my grandparents, that the climate issue is getting worse. I need to tell them what can we do in order to slow down the damage to the climate. Because of the delay of climate consequences, many older people lack the idea of the results of temperature rising, therefore they act little regard to it. But recently, the results are getting more obvious. For me, I will live on this planet for at least 60 years. If I don't make any change, I will suffer because of it, and I don't want this kind of result. It's crucial for our generation to act and change, and we have to do it now.

This lecture could not have come at a better time.  We will be facing what might be the biggest election of our lifetime.  For many of us, this will be the first elections we can vote in, I know it will be for me.  It is vitally important that we keep the climate crisis in mind when voting, as we should choose the candidate who is dedicated to the future of our planet and our generation. I believe that this important election could also not have come at a better time.  Our generation is surrounded by opinions and information that is available at any moment.  I have had this discussion with my dad, that my generation relies on information from social media outlets while his is primarily from the news.  Because of this, we get unfiltered, quick information that likely won’t be covered by traditional news outlets.  I believe this is likely why a lot of our generation has turned to activism and why we hold such strong convictions, we are reminded everyday of them.
    <br><br>

I loved Ken’s statement about how important it is to communicate with our parents.  Although mine are very stubborn about their beliefs, they respect mine as well.  My father, a BBQ lover from Texas, has cut red meat out of his diet upon my suggestion (this was more for health, but I will take the win.)  After I went vegan, both my parents have voluntarily chosen non-dairy options (Mom: “Look, I got oat milk at the store! Are you proud?”) based on their environmental impact.  Although I doubt either will go vegan, or even vegetarian, I think they are both more informed on the impacts of their choices

Another generational issue, this time on why Ken’s generation hasn’t acted upon these problems. Many people ignored these issues and only now are we starting to see them quickly manifest into horrible storms and wild weather. I tend to agree with Ken when he says that many of the climate deniers come from the developed world, and more specifically Ken’s generation. Not only do these deniers influence other people’s judgment on the climate crisis, but they delay valuable action from policy makers and the general public. I admire Ken for speaking to my generation and educating us on this matter, but I think that some of these topics he mentions can become repetitive. Yes climate change is a generational issue, but I think that simply stating that “the older you are, the less urgent you will likely find the climate crisis.” is just as obvious as saying “anthropogenic climate change is destroying the Earth”. I know we’re still in the beginning part of the class where we talk about climate change and what it is, but I think there's more that can be covered than just the generational issue. In the second lecture, Ken prompts us to act now and I can’t agree more. Not only is Ken’s generation not acting, we have to make up for this lack of action by starting work on the world right now. I also agree on the point that Ken makes about policy  makers and what they decide to do. If your congress-person supports car infrastructure instead of bicycle paths, then you won’t be able to help the environment by riding a bike instead of driving a car. Youth movements and other demonstrations of political pressure on society can alter how people think, and I think that our youth needs to stand up to our politicians and persuade them to make climate change a top priority. Greta Thurnberg is a great representation of youth rising up and trying to show others how pressing of a matter climate change is.

The feeling of helplessness is one of the toughest to combat.  For me, the part of this lecture that resonated the most was the appeal to young voters. Having a tangible, actionable plan to help is the only cure to the dread and unknowingness that comes with helplessness. For people my age especially I feel that this power comes from utilizing our privilege to vote for the people and policies in local elections that we believe will benefit our planet the most. This statement is very impactful for e personally, as well as for everyone else in Isla vista because there is currently an incredibly important local election that will impact the state of the planet and Santa barbara’s environment specifically. This election is the one to keep Joan Hartmann on the board as a county supervisor, she is running against an opponent that is pro-fracking and funded entirely by oil money. Isla Vista and thus us students are the swing district for this election and if we don’t turn out to vote it could cause terrible consequences for our environment.  By volunteering for Joan Hartmann, I have gained real-life experiences as to how one can, on a daily basis, fight back against climate change and those who are disregarding its impact.  Actions like these are how we as a generation can attempt to help make the change. 
    <br><br>
In addition to the point about young people voting, it was also mentioned that creative solutions were necessary to implement the amount of change that we need to see in our society to begin undoing the damage that our prior generations have caused.  The idea that we need to fundamentally reinvent our culture in order to invoke the necessary change is a lofty statement that could easily and understandably lead to helplessness for some. We must, therefore, be the generation of creative solutions, in the forms of both technological advances and grassroots participation and movements I believe this is something that we are all entirely capable of.

I greatly agree that when the issues brought about by climate change are addressed, the feeling of helplessness is hard to counter. I speak personally as often times with educating the public about climate change, the issues are presented without a plan of action included. Therefore, a feeling of inevitability and lack of trust in oneself to put forth said change comes about. It may be hard for some to realize, but individually you do have the power to help change the world. Whether that be through voting or activism within the community. I am glad that Ken brought up the actions that we, as individuals and as the new generation, can take. The difference in voting impact the last election may have been drastic (1/3 of our generation vs 2/3 of those 60+ years old), but there is still time to change that and for this generation to rise to help slow the climate crisis. Your statement of how reinventing the current culture may lead to helplessness was one that struck a cord as I have had that feeling many a time in the past. However, in seeing the your and many other comments in this video, it brings hope that the time for the current generation to put their foothold in changing the world may finally come fully into fruition.

I agree with you that voting is one of the most accessible and impactful ways we can combat the climate crisis. I also think it’s wonderful that you’ve dedicated your knowledge, time, and resources to support policymakers who will fight for the environment. I didn’t know about this election situation before, and now I can see the real life results that come from the act of voting, especially in district elections such as this. 
    <br><br>


As a soon-to-be first-time voter this year––and I assume that many of us are first-time voters as well––I know I need to educate myself about the candidates I can vote for and their stance on important issues, specifically climate change. I’ve never been very invested in politics because as a minor, I had no effect on the political system. Now, it’s urgent that we all gain knowledge about the people running for office, the people who represent us in each part of the government, and the different propositions that affect our environment. 

    <br><br>

The statistics about voting demographics were a bit daunting to me. Only 1/3 of those in the youngest age group of eligible voters voted in 2018. Ken continues to state that our generation cares the most about the climate crisis, but why doesn’t that translate at the polls? Perhaps it’s the feeling of helplessness, the doubts that a single vote will have any impact. I know I feel that way sometimes. However, Ken is optimistic about our generation being able to create change, and there’s a tangible way to accomplish it. By voting and encouraging others to vote, we will increase voter participation even in the slightest sense. And if more people believe that their vote matters, we’ll be able to enact more change in our political system.

I’m surprised by people who still deny the face of climate change and their way see climate change as insignificant consequences. Many people still think that the changes in weather in daily life are not proof of climate change; however, climate change is more about a broader perspective and long term causes of environmental change. Because people cannot visualize the significant consequences of climate change, many of the public deny climate change, which results in nothing in action. Also, I feel pity for the animals which have no idea what’s going on about the climate and suffer for the danger we bring to them. Not only the animals, but the future generations and the minority groups in the society will have to undertake the consequences. Additionally, the older age group of people doesn’t see climate change as a priority because climate change will not affect them that much. Accordingly, I believe this is the problem with a lack of literacy as people are not educated enough to understand the severity of climate change.

    <br><br>

In our generations, I agree that people should vote. The“oldest group of people who votes has twice as great as the youngest generation of the voter,” which takes parts in a massive proportion of the political election. We, as the younger generation, should speak up and participate more in environmental campaigns. We should exert political pressure on the government, which may result in cultural and political changes. Hopefully, we could promote more intergenerational learning in which transfer the knowledge from children to parent. This process takes a long time, but I believe that we will change from a consuming culture into a less materialistic lifestyle.

I greatly appreciate that Ken is telling us ways that we can have a significant impact on the climate crisis for I often don’t know the best way to take action. I do have hope for my generation’s voting habits to greatly impact climate change. Ever since the 2016 presidential election, I think we all have a powerful and real understanding of the importance of voter turnout. In the past four years it seems as though the push, especially for democrats and young people, to vote has been at the forefront of our attention. Furthermore, a large percentage of my peers see climate change as one of the biggest issues today. For that reason I believe much more voting will occur in line with climate change goals in the 2020 election. 
    <br><br>

One of the hardest parts about Ken’s suggestion for young people to gain control of government is that we are often not trusted in the political arena. We see this in the example of Greta Thunberg and other youth climate activists who are regularly bashed in the press a being “too young” or “too inexperienced” to know anything about the climate crisis. While experience is obviously important, I hope that voters will begin to take a chance on young candidates as many do have the capability to catalyze serious change. 
    <br><br>

As for the suggestion to educate our parents and families, I believe it is worth the effort but that it could discourage many young people. Older generations are very stuck in their ways and have the mindset that they know more than their children and grandchildren about pretty much everything. When going into these discussions with their parents and older people in their families, they should be aware that their efforts might not have the desired effect. This still should not dissuade them from at least trying in the first place.

When it comes to the older generations, I do believe that they are fairly stuck in their ways when it comes to the climate crisis, after all their denial or at least delay is what caused this problem in the first place; however, I do believe that if anyone would be able to convince them to change their state of mind, that would be those closest to them, and I think as children this gives us a great opportunity. Though since each family is different I don’t think that everyone my age could accomplish this, but theoretically if even 1/1000 children in this country had a meaningful discussion with a single parent (simply assuming half of the country are parents) that would be 100,000 parents who would understand the importance of climate activism. This effect would be absolutely huge and should therefore not be underestimated.
    <br><br>

I think that the example of the the civil rights movement is a great example for that needs to happen today to solve the climate crisis. Since the older generation has exemplified that they won't fix the climate crisis themselves, it is up to young people to make their voice heard in politics and cause change. The civil rights movement shows how young people indeed can cause massive political (and therefore social change) by getting involved in the political process. Just by the effect we can have by dedicating one day per year voting for action on climate change would have an enormous effect if enough young people would do it.
<br><hr>
I too was confused about how we could take action to help prevent further damage and this video brought up a few a good ways that we could do that. For instance, I do agree with the point that we as a generation need to alter our voting habits. Looking at the voting polls it is mostly the older generation, those that are more likely to not believe that climate change is taking place, that are going in and voting for the policies that aren't helping aid climate change. Personally, I believe that the younger generation is not voting because they think that they aren't educated enough on the issue and that their vote does not matter, when really it does. We can help educate our generation on these topics and increase the percentage of our generation that votes. Our generation understands climate change and its severe consequences so if we were to all go vote, we would collectively make a big change. 
    <br><br>
I also agree with your point that voters don't have a large amount of confidence in the younger candidates, and that if they gave them a chance they would bring something new to the table that the older politicians are missing. I do believe that the older generation is very stuck in their ways, but our generation should not shy away from attempting to educate them. Not everyone that our generation tries to educate will be close-minded and unwillingly to understand a new perspective. Our generation just needs to put in the effort of going out to vote and educating others as well as themselves.

<br><hr>
I think you are making a great point on how the younger generation is not trusted, and what we value is not taken seriously. I believe this is not only a large-scale problem, but it may also apply to individuals, which makes the point that Ken made about the youth movement more critical. We have to keep speaking and learning about the issue to let others know that we are serious about this, and this is a dire situation. And of course, a larger voter body of the younger generation will definitely make things easier. 
    <br><br>

I feel the same way that changing someone else's values and beliefs is easier said than done. Sometimes, trying to convince your parents maybe even harder, as they spent years raising us and educating us using their almost-fixed knowledge and experiences. However, it's nice to bear in mind that we do learn the knowledge that's beyond what they have taught us.  It won't be a one- or two-day discussion, but instead, it might take months or even years. As we grow up and take control of our own lives and see more of the world, it will be us to deliver the latest knowledge and information. Many of us are the ones who educate them on how to figure out technology and the Internet today. 
    <br><br>

I somehow have faith in this child-parent intergenerational learning, because me and my mum used to have very conflicting ideas, but after we have respectful conservations constantly, exchanging our ideas and thoughts, I can see her embracing those new values that younger people have. 
    <br><br>

I also read this in a book recently. It says we need to speak out, especially to those who have opposite opinions. They might disagree and even use disrespectful language, but only in this way can it leads to change, even if it's just a little. If this change happens, it is not that we are now the same. It means to motivate more of understanding and reflection. This is a two-way effect. Hope it makes sense.

While watching these video lectures, I won't lie, I zoned out, would play on my phone, and vaguely soak up the information, but something piqued my interest and it was Ken's solution; to take control of the planet we live in. This acted as some sort of "call to action" for me as I felt almost instantly reinvigorated and ready to go out and do whatever I could to help. But he's right, the people in power want to stay in power and will just look to promote those who agree with those same ideologies and share the same greed. To make the drastic change needed we have to uproot the problem at its source and take the wheel before this car spirals any more out of control.

This lecture struck one very important note above the rest. Despite the devastating effects that the climate crisis can have, at the end of the day this crisis is an opportunity. I completely agree with Ken’s emphasis on the importance of voting as a general opportunity to create change at a large scale. By putting leaders in office who have more agreeable action plans regarding climate change, we may be able to accelerate what are otherwise seemingly challenging cultural changes. Beyond that, I think that the sentiment in this lecture is one that ought to be everpresent when it comes to discussing climate. A lot has gone wrong already and this issue is urgent, but there are specific and measurable things that everyone can do to make a difference. From a lifestyle choice that begins with diet and consumer consciousness at the grocery store this weekend to researching and selecting the right candidates in November, we all have an opportunity to make a difference sooner rather than later. Just because those before us didn’t do everything they could does not mean that we shouldn’t do anything that we can. If you really think about it, we have the chance to be the generation that literally saved the planet. Not only is that absolutely essential for the sake of our posterity, but in an unfortunate way it is really just plain cool. I think that putting a more positive message forward when it comes to what we’re capable of may work to motivate people who are otherwise lathargic.

I completely agree that we should try and see the "positive" in the situation and use this as an opportunity to do better than past generations. By no means am I downplaying the horrific consequences of the climate crisis or believe that we should be grateful for this change to make a difference, however, since we cannot reverse what previous generations have already destroyed, the best answer is to improve. Maybe the older generations are simply not capable or too irresponsible to take action and save our planet. Maybe they actually did not care enough about our generation's future and well-being. I totally believe Ken when he says that those people were well aware of the danger they were putting our planet in since I cannot imagine anyone being so oblivious and naive. That's why we have to take initiative now if we ever want to make a difference. This is our chance to prove to the older generations that "little things" - like changing one's diet, reducing the use of cars, reusing items and recycling them - actually do matter. Instead of complaining about everything that we CAN'T change, why don't we focus on what we CAN do to help the environment? As you said, we could be remembered as the generation that literally saved the planet! In my opinion, if we approach this issue in a more encouraging and positive light, hopefully, more people will want to be a part of this life-changing movement and we will actually be able to show the previous generations that we can do so much better.

After watching both videos, I gained the knowledge that the older generation will not do anything and the younger cannot wait around for them to make a dramatic change in the climate crisis. As the people of power are not adjusting to the issue, the professor’s video acknowledges that we still can do something to mitigate the crisis. I believe the main aspect that we can contribute is to vote for those that are in the position to help and better the planet. Since the older generation is in control, we might as well take advantage of it and control who we vote for. 
    <br><br>

Near the end of this video, Ken mentions to take a direct personal approach, with which I definitely agree is one of the most influential ways to create change. The familial bond is strong within most families and if we do express that this matter is truly important for our futures, I believe it could start the first step to positive change. When Ken stated that what we are living in today is the most dangerous and uncertainty points of time, I came to understand that there is hope and that statement should give us an even greater reason to create a new world.

i agree with your statement that the older generation will not do anything and it is up to us the younger generation to fix what somewhat feels like the unfixable. It was annoying to hear majority of our elders don't even believe climate change isn't a top issue. Specifically when Ken mentioned in "What a new generation can do to migrate the climate crisis" people over 65 have twice a much voting power was the younger generation it became even more frustrating.However, I feel it should be our duty now to vote for those in politics who want to make a proper change. I know many people who simply don't vote or feel their vote doesn't matter. Although our planet might have damage, there still can be an optimistic outcome if we use our voice.
    <br><br>
The direct intergenerational approach Ken touched on seemed like the most important idea for a difference. Word of mouth has always been known to spread like wildfire whether it was used for good or bad. Since taking this class, many of the documentaries and articles I've read have come up in conversations with my friends and family. This approach seems the most useful as the people closest you are more likely listen as you voice your concerns about future offspring. In my opinion and too many others, our youth has been the most positively impactful when it comes to saving our planet. Nonetheless, there is still faith providing a healthy environment for incoming generations.

First of all, I would like to thank Ken for addressing the causal relationship between government policy and climate change. After watching your video, I understand that in order to assure prosperity and maintain highly industrialized. Our society rely highly on fossil fuels. Without fossil fuels, our lives will be much harder. We no longer have clean tap water, electricity and wifi. Under these alluring benefits, most of us refuse to give up the life we have; while for some companies, they refuse to give up the great amount of revenue behind burning fossil fuels. All these contribute to climate change. Gratefully, we, the newer generation, have a strong will in saving our world. We promote the idea known as the 4Rs: Reduce, reuse, recycle, and recovery. In today’s world, we encourage others to bring their own staw, use biodegradable utensils when they purchase their drink. Besides these, I am glad that ken has pointed out that we should also vote! For now, even though we are too young to be in the senate and be in charge of the affairs, we are able to make a difference by voting. Our vote is powerful. As 2020 is here, we are able to choose the one who is willing to take responsibility for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas.

I completely agree in the ways that both Ken and you listed in how we, as a generation who can impact the future can move to address the climate crisis. I think that out of these different strategies addressed in your comment and the lecture videos, the most important way to take action on the climate crisis is to address the fossil fuel interest within governments especially the U.S. given that it produces the most carbon emissions per person of pretty much any other country, even China. The reason why I believe this is so important to address is because until politicians do not have their pockets full of money from the fossil fuel industry, they will continue to block any legislation that endangers the industry in attempt to reduce greenhouse emissions. Voting is thus extremely important in order to do so, and I think voters (especially young voters) should do their part and look into who politicians get their campaign money from and make sure that we are not electing politicians who will clearly be biased in their decision making regarding the climate. With politician’s interest primarily in reelection and fundraising for their campaign we cannot wait for them to change their ways, we simply need to send a message and show that corruption in the form of letting fossil fuel companies influence political decisions through contributing to campaign finance needs.

Professor Hiltner’s video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” seemed to be a very simple yet gripping and plausible call to action for our generation against climate change. The people who currently wield the most power on the planet are from the very generation that has done arguably the most environmental harm, and it is this fact that Hiltner begins his proposal on. The younger generations need to take control of the planet now, as the situation is far too urgent to sit back and wait for our turn. However, even though the generation ages 18-29 has had its highest poll/voting turnouts, the older generation (ages 65+) dominates and more than doubles our numbers in the voting booths. 
    <br><br>

Although I very much agree that voting and political pressure are our most direct and impactful method of implementing change, Hiltner’s discussion regarding child to parent intergenerational learning was most compelling to me. I can’t think of a time where environmental issues and climate change were discussed in a serious or meaningful context in my family. Although it is commonly believed that politics can often be divisive and detrimental to a family dynamic, climate change definitely goes beyond the matter and is something that I could see myself discussing with my parents, friends, and family in the future. Although Western culture should be praised for all that it has accomplished and introduced over the years, one of its central pitfalls often is the downside to the consumer, materialistic culture, and the devastating consequences that occur as a result of it. I think that “fundamentally reinventing” the western consumer culture will be the most difficult and widespread challenge because it has permeated almost every culture in the developed world. 
    <br><br>

Lastly, I took genuine account of the video’s reference to youth movements in our recent past that have sparked many social and cultural changes that have spread across national and international boundaries. I think that using these movements as precedent, as they were all predominantly spearheaded by the youth, can be very encouraging and impactful on our modern climate crisis movement, since it often involves such heavy and disheartening topics.

Political change is the only real and effective way to combat the climate crisis. Even by voting for those who want to fight against climate change, it is likely policy will not change due to the democratic system. The idea of rebellions to combat climate change, to me, personally, will not make noticeable change. Protests toward climate change do not change any laws. Climate change deniers will not change their mind because children are in the streets blocking their roads. This differs greatly from the civil rights protests. This is a much more global issue, while the civil rights was a specific group of people being killed and attacked in their everyday life.

In this weeks lecture videos it is discussed that the baby boomer generation takes no fault for the climate crisis and are still in denial that it is the most pressing issue in today’s world. Those that should be upset about the climate crisis are among those that have done the least to create it. These groups include the poorest half of the world that have creates less than five percent of the total co2 emissions in the world, the children of this generation, and the poor plants and animals of the planet that are seemingly defenseless in the situation.
    <br><br>

This generation, when polled, voted that climate change waste the eighteenth most prominent issue of their lifetime behind immigration reform, economy and social security. These issues that they believe are more important than climate change will literally cease to exist if climate change continues. Honestly, who cares who is in what country, with or without money, if everything is burning or already beneath the surface of the ocean?
    <br><br>

I truly believe that these people are ignorant and selfish in that they feel it will not affect them in their lifetime, therefore it is of little to no importance. They feel there is no need to be educated on the topic or take action in reversing the change because they will never have to see the effects. This is such a terrible mindset and the entire reason we are in this crisis in the first place, due to selfish, greedy, and ignorant people more invested in making money than the lives and the future of the world around them.

Your rhetorical question questioning the political controversy surrounding the climate crisis really grabbed my attention, because it is so true. Although today's government rightfully focus a lot of time and effort on issues such as immigration and economy in order to ensure our nation's security and way of life, they too often neglect the issues the climate is starting to show right in front of our eyes. Personally, I hate that fighting back against the climate crisis is a political, even partisan, issue. I just don't understand how something that is clearly going to effect ALL people in a future closer than we know is still being debated and used as a partisan agenda. Relating back to the lecture, I now have a cleared understanding as to why voting is so important. I found it sad that 2/3 people over the age of 65 voted in the 2018 midterm election where as only 1/3 of the 18-29 year old population voted. In conclusion, our generation appears to be so vocal about our demand for change and criticism of the President on the internet and social media platforms such as twitter; however, I believe now more than ever is our time to actually go out and vote for candidates that value the voice and concerns of today's youth.

After watching both lectures, “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” and “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis,” I was somewhat disappointed in Ken’s take on the climate problem. Although he has done a great job in alerting us of the potential destruction of the world we live in and what has led to this, I still feel that I haven’t learned much that will prove helpful. I completely understand that it is important to know what  we’re talking about and the history of it, but if disaster is already upon us, shouldn’t we be focusing more on taking action? Since the first day of class I’ve been hoping to learn what I can do personally every day to make a difference. While I understand that engaging in political action to change policies is very important, I feel that most people in my generation are more likely to take personal steps like making changes in their lifestyles to make a difference. I’m just hoping that Ken will make it a point to focus more on the future and realistic suggestions on improvement rather than apologizing for his generation’s mistakes.

I have also noticed and agree that have yet to gain much knowledge on what we can actually do ourselves about the climate crisis instead of just learning more and more about what it is along with its affects and effects, but I believe there is a justified reason for that. As Ken mentioned during lecture, this course is intentionally off to a depressing start, but he plans on dipping into the ways in which we can all help and make a difference a few weeks into the course, not right away. I honestly think this is a great approach and method of teaching because, at least for me personally, these past two weeks have literally opened my eyes to the destruction and atrocity of climate change by realizing all the negative effects that are caused by this crisis, along with what is the actual root of it. I don't think I would be as intrigued as I am in regard to wanting to make a difference if I wasn't first enthralled by this monstrosity of the climate crisis. I have never been more transfixed into such an impulse to want to make any type of difference in this world as I have been by everything Ken has revealed to us. I have been simply scared into action.

As a non-American citizen who can’t vote, I am wondering is there another efficient solution I can do to mitigate the climate crisis. 
    <br><br>

So far, I heard from my Chinese classmate there is a plan going on about reduce plane emissions and establishing a carbon offset website for international students on campus. If they complete the program, I am willing to do so.
     <br><br>

I think the children to parents approach to influence the older generation can also make a difference. I switch my diet to vegan last summer because I read the book “How Not to Die” by Dr. Michael Greger. It talks about how one can prevent diseases and live healthier by merely eating a plant-based diet. Then I share this book with my family; my father alone has benefited a lot from a vegan diet. He had a dramatic reduction in his blood pressures, from over 150mmHg to 114mmHg. He also lost 10 Pounds within three months and feeling more energetic. He told me that it is because of his persistence in changing his diet and eating habit, and he even didn’t use any medicine to cure his hypertension. Besides, switching to pant- based diet would also reduce the CO2 emission to the atmosphere. He said by doing so, can benefit our bodies as well as the planet.

After finishing the two lecture videos, I was reminded of how urgent and time-sensitive the issue of the climate crisis is. After many years and generations of people who remain inactive and deny that the climate is changing, I think that is good that younger generations are finally stepping up to the plate and spreading awareness of the growing problem that will affect not only us, but the generations to come in the future. One thing that Ken said that I found interesting was that one of the ways that we can promote collective action is through child to parent intergenerational learning. I think that this approach is effective because it can educate the older generations, and since they make up such a large portion of voters, a bigger change can be made in the political standpoint of climate change. I believe that voting is one of the most influential ways that we can voice our opinions and if more people are educated on the importance and urgency of the climate crisis, big changes can be made.

While I do agree with you that the younger generations are finally stepping up and that this is going to affect the rest of our generation and generations to come, I don't know if I completely agree with you that voting is the most influential way to create change. As Ken said in his video, 2/3 of voters are the older generation, and even if we up our voter count, it  does not mean that the ratio will completely flip. There will still be plenty of older voters that may even still outweigh the younger generations. I feel like the main thing that must happen to actually drive change is raising awareness and changing the elder generations minds, whether that be through science and facts or through emotional guilt tripping or something of that sort. Without gaining a sufficient percentage of older voters, I don't know if we will have quite enough to make political change in office in the time we have to do so.


<br><hr>
I agreed with what Ken said as well on talking more about this issues to everyone around us. The more we talk about it the more awareness is spread which can lead to more activism and therefore a greater political impact. Politicians tend to fall in line with what the people say. As generations who have little to no representation on decisions regarding the earth, it is very important for us to talk about it more and educate those around us who may not have any understanding of it all.

I think it is our responsibility to "fix" what the former generations did and try to make a more habitable Earth for ourselves, or generations after us, just the same as what Ken talked about in these two videos. We have to make sure that, instead of "surviving" on the Earth that is becoming more and more uninhabitable, we should do something right now. Like Ken said, "You need to take control of the planet". I also found that "Child to Parent Intergenerational Learning" is really a smart way and it should be advocated more in the future because it's going to save our future.

I agree. Before watching this video, I expected the older generation to care and try harder to fix this issue. This video made me less patient and helped me realize that they don’t care as much, and they don’t really have reasons to care. This is my future, not theirs. They’ve already enjoyed the world. By the time the worst hits, they won’t be here to face it. But this issue is something I will have to face. I have more at stake than they do, so it makes sense that I should care more than they do. This helped me realize that maybe instead of waiting on the older generation to act, I should change things myself. They’ve gotten to see corals and enjoy clean air. I want to run knowing I’ll still be able to do it for a long time, that I won’t soon be trapped indoors because of deadly heat or unbreathable air; I want to enjoy the beach without thinking about how sea levels will rise and how 90% of corals will die by 2050, but I can’t because the future I’m facing is full of fires, smoke, floods, and dead animals. It’s already happening. There are more fires, larger fires, longer fire seasons, and 50% of corals have died in the last couple decades. As much as I would like to do other things, and pursue other interests, I have to deal with climate change first, because if this progresses, I won’t be able to do anything I like. These are my desires, so the older generations probably don’t care. If they don’t care, why are they the ones in power? As Ken points out, it is because they are voted in power. In the 2018 midterm election, ⅓ of 18-29 year olds voted, a higher fraction than usual but still half of ⅔, the fraction of people ages 60+ that voted.  
     <br><br>
One practical and interesting method Ken suggested was the “Child to parent intergenerational learning,” where we just communicate the issue to our parents. This makes sense, as climate change threatens our futures, and our parents care about our futures. I think talking to my parents about climate change as something that affects my future rather than just other people, or the animals will make them care more. I have brought the issue up with them, but not in the context of my future. I think I will try this.

As I'm turning my focus more into the global and environmental issues that my generation constantly share on social media, my desire to vote and become more involved in taking action is growing stronger. I used to have this belief that the voices of all the concerned individuals from my generation would not be heard if they protested because the older generation(s) would over power us anyways. However, I've recently made the realization that having that amount of hope on my generation to make a difference is delusional. High school students who were part of the Black Lives Matter protests had set an example of how influential and powerful we are as a young and upcoming generation if we are unified and deeply passionate for what we protest for. 

     <br><br>

Being part of the generation that is heavily depended on to combat the climate crisis and combat those who oppose it puts pressure on a lot of us, but I think this pressure is necessary because it creates an incentive for us to act fast and effectively.
      <br><br>
One effective method is to attempt to share the post to a friend, to those who follow you, or to the public, because the power of social media is being able to create engagements with a lot more people than you may think. Most times, sharing information that come in the form of an instagram picture, tweet, or whatever you use (also if you share information over the internet you had read, do a little research on the facts to make sure you're not spreading false information) , you will actually enlighten someone with highly important knowledge. Of course, that is just one of the methods. The more effective method, is voting.

I agree with your first paragraph. I too believe that my generations voice would not be heard because of the people in power who are much older and don’t agree with what we believe. Even if the problem is right in front of them they will not budge, it’s whatever they think and they try and justify reasons for why these events that have never happened before are happening now. But after watching this video I feel like yes, we are the future and it’s up to us to make a change. If we all come together we can be heard and make a change. The past movements have indeed proved this exact point, youth rebellion has changed America and it has had a profound influence on some generations. Explaining to older generations such as our parents is a way to begin because they obviously love us and breaking down how bad the situation is make them come to the realization that this crisis has to become a priority. I have been vocal about what I’ve been learning and letting my parents know that I want to have a future, I want my children to be able to experience the things I have gotten to without worrying that the world will end before they have a chance to live it. 
      <br><br>
Regarding the second paragraph I also agree, social media has become so huge, most people now are on it. Social media would be really really effective because there are a lot more youth on it now a days. It is also where people from all over the world can find these posts and like you said be enlightened by what they read. Spreading this information can be very effective because these individuals might be around the same age as us and it is their future and their future children's future. Voting is also another very effective method because those in power like the professor said are people in his own age group or older who don’t believe in the climate crisis. Going out to vote we can make a change because we are deciding what we want and don’t, these older generations are no longer completely controlling how the country we live in is run.

I found Ken's video to be truly impacting in making it clear to people that climate change is a crisis that must be acted on now.  I found it powerful with Ken urging my generation to take control of the situation and take action.  Considering that this issue of climate change is more prioritized among my generation shows how we must make huge efforts to change the way we live.  In educating ourselves and educating generations ahead of us, we take an approach in helping to better our circumstances.  I have already started to speak with my parents over the issue of the climate crisis.  This class has impacted the way I view how wasteful we can be.  As I have come to see how serious this issue is, I hope many other people realize we are in a serious crisis and hope to better it.

<p>
The part of this I found the most interesting was the line, "You need to take control of the planet."  This was particularly interesting as my initial response was, "okay, then let us!"  I believe the biggest issue is not our lack of knowledge regarding climate change, but our inability to take control.  I know Professor Hiltner's line was likely meant in a somewhat more rhetorical sense, basically telling us that only we have the knowledge and desire to make a lasting change.  
      <br><br>


The statistics on the age of various positions of power worldwide was interesting, but also proves my point.  We are currently led by people who will never have to deal with the worst of climate change.  Even the small few who may experience a climate catastrophe will just use their money and influence to move away.  It is interesting to compare this with younger CEO's and leaders who are acutely aware of the issue.  Elon Musk is trying to colonize Mars since he thinks it is our only way to survive.  And AOC's Green New Deal seems radical to many of these older people, but to us it seems like the only logical thing to do.  
      <br><br>


The only way my generation will be able to take control will be to vote out everyone who does not believe (officially or otherwise) in the climate crisis.  Though it is important to register everyone in my generation to vote, that alone will likely never be enough.  The main issue is that older generations tend to vote more than younger generations.  So I believe the main way we will be able to affect the polls is by talking to our parents and grandparents.  If we change their minds, we change a huge part of the voter demographic.  This is the best we can do, with our current political system.

Watching these two lectures, I've began to notice Ken's call to action. He interjects initially to both explain the complacency that generations prior like his have assumed, while also the ability as a younger generation we have make impacting change.
      <br><br>
I also find it interesting in his breakdown of statistics on those in the most prominent leading roles in the country, and of the demographic they're made up of. While powerful in their capacities, many of the people he describes are elected officials who rely on votes to remain in office. Just as the example given earlier of Barack Obama and his condemnation of equal marriage early on in his political career, to a much later retraction and acceptance of such a vital issue. This along countless other policy shifts throughout the history of our country represents that the people do have power. Within our Democratic Republic, individuals have often belittled the unique role they play in our government. With  the emphasis placed on the need for the youngest generation (of gen z) to assume an active role, Ken urges us with the reality that we will face the brute of climate effects. He also touches on that so often younger people remain compliant in that we will 'one day' assume these leading roles, leaving close to nothing to be done now. By doing this we continue to leave older generations to work on the problems they've helped to spur. The slow and sometimes lack of realization is caused by the fast rate of effects stemming from a problem such as climate change. Its fact that as we age our personalities solidify, and change just becomes harder, and with the legislation and lifestyle practices proposed, these changes are viewed as 'too radical.' Ultimately though, in seeing nation wide reform, a lot of it will be left to voting and how active individuals campaign and influence policy. It'll really begin to show as the younger generation practices sustainable lifestyle changes, and vote to actively place climate change concerns at the forefront.
<br><hr>


I agree with you that the line that stuck out to me was “You need to take control of the planet”. It is often frustrating to hear this because I like to think that my generation is trying to make a change, yet older generations continue to suppress us. Whether it is older generations not taking young adults seriously, or ignoring our protests, young adults are struggling to make a difference. I also agree with Kevin that we must take control politically, specifically by voting. If more young people voted, we could vote in politicians who make a difference and understand our frustrations. It was extremely interesting that Ken spoke about how older generations control most our world today, as he stated that the average age for those in congress is over 60 and the average age for those in the supreme court is over 70. He also commented on how only 1/3 of those ages 18-29 voted, while 2/3 of those over 60 voted. If we made an effort to vote, we could completely change the the progress being made in the government. 
      <br><br>

            I also think child to parent intergenerational learning is crucial to stopping climate change. I have been vegetarian for years and this has impacted how my parents eat, as they see why I am so passionate about the environment. While they are not as concerned about climate change as I am, they are starting to change their minds and understand how this affects everyone. If more young people made an effort to talk to their parents about issues such as climate change, progress would be achieved much faster. 
      <br><br>

            Lastly, these lecture videos have made me want to become more educated on environmental issues. After watching these videos I felt more encouraged to research political ideas on how to stop climate change, such as The Green New Deal. We have a voice and we must be more educated so that we use it for the better.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with much of what you said, especially the part about how younger generations are remaining compliant.  However, I think part of the problem with focusing primarily on the younger generations is that by the time we are old enough to effect lasting change, it may be past the point of return.  This is not to say that we should be complacent or that we should not register to vote, it is just an acknowledgement that we will need to influence the older generations now while there is still time to reverse or at least mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
It is unbelievably sad how true this is. The fact that older generations aren't placing as much of a large emphasis on climate change as they should be is such a sad reflection of the generational differences that exist within our country.  If we actually do want change to happen within America, we and the rest of the younger generalizations must mobilize ourselves as voters. We have the numbers, power, and reasoning to do it, but many of us lack conviction. If we do manage to mobilize ourselves into the voting polls we could have such a far-reaching and profound impact on the political and environmental landscape of countries all around the world.  In many ways, our actions could lead to a new cultural and environmental revolution.
      <br><br>

If we really want to leave the world as a better place for our future generations, we must act now. 2020 is a US election year and if we vote and act correctly, significant change will be able to take place. Thirty years from now, I don't want to look back at myself and be disappointed in my actions or lack thereof. I want to be able to look back fondly and say that I'm glad that I took action and helped save this world from its destruction.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that voting is the number one way to use our collective power to make a change. This lecture was all about a call to action; Ken is telling us we need to take control of our government. I believe that increased awareness of the problem to our parents, anyone in the older generation willing to listen, and even those in the younger generation can help us get them voting. Before taking this class, I knew climate change was an issue but didn’t want to do much to act on it. However, the further we dive into this class, the more I feel we need to act now. In addition to convincing your parents and their friends to act, we need to let them know how to act. We need them to vote. One thing I wanted to point out about the child to parent conversation is that for me personally, my parents were the ones who originally introduced me to the issue of climate change. From my experience, most children have similar political stances to their parents. So it's not just about convincing them, but we need them to act too. They have friends, coworkers and in general a larger circle of influence than we do. I guess my point is that we not only need to convince our parents to believe in climate change, but to become adamant activist of the cause. The more people who are serious about making a change, as opposed to just admitting the problem, the quicker we can act.

<br><hr>
I agree completely with this statement and the frustration behind it. I believe the younger generation does want to make a change, and that the best way to come about this issue is to vote. However, from the people I know, it is evident that most of us do not vote, with the mindset that since not much of the younger generation is voting it won't make a difference anyway. Our generation not voting is also driven by laziness, or at least that is from what I have seen. My goal here would be to start convincing my friends to go vote and explain the severity of this situation. 
      <br><br>
Another goal I would like to accomplish is to convince my parents to vote for the planet instead of themselves, through child to parent intragenerational learning. I am aware that my parents' primary concerns are also healthcare and social security as they are nearly the age of retirement and need a stable future. But I would like to convince them to vote for someone who will take environmental action. As I understand they are voting for the stability of their own futures, they should also take into consideration our futures. The futures of their children and possible grandchildren. My cousin decided she did not want to have a child in the state of this earth, and it honestly baffled the whole older generation of my family who were expecting grandchildren. They brushed off the issue and said that the climate crisis was not that serious and the effects wouldn't arise until hundreds of years in advance. My goal is to make them see this issue and that it is already occurring.
<br><hr>
I think you eloquently reiterated Ken’s point about the state of American politicians, the importance of the younger generation to vote, and why the sharing of climate change knowledge between generations is absolutely necessary in our current lives. Although voting is an individual act, it is inherently part of a collectivist activity. The older generation, who don’t rank climate crisis high at all on a list of issues of concern, have a higher voter turnout than the younger generations, therefore, skewing the representation of climate crisis concern. Interpersonal communication between family members about the climate crisis is an effective way to change beliefs and ultimately raise the amount of concern for the climate crisis across all voter populations. 

I also love how Ken brought up the youth rebellion and cultural change that happened in the American 60s and 70s. The political and social changes that came about from those youth rebellions give me hope that my generation can be the modern youth rebellion that brings about similar, if not more, change.

<br><hr>

I am also intrigued by the line Ken used in this video. I felt the same frustration as I'm sure many others in our generation felt when they heard the line "You need to take control of the planet." Our generation has the knowledge and will to combat climate change, but we are still being suppressed by the older generations. It's incredibly hard to take control when the majority of the people in power to actually make a difference are older individuals who want to do anything but help combat climate change. In my own experience, our generation has been viewed by previous generations as too naïve, dreamy, and wishy washy. They believe we have unrealistic expectations for the future, but it is this very closeminded mindset that they have that prevents all of us from making any progress in our society. As long as they continue to suppress us, nothing will change. If we could do something to take control, we would, and honestly I feel like we are trying harder than any previous generation to raise the awareness needed to combat this crisis. It's just frustrating when we're constantly being undermined in our attempts. For example, the whole issue regarding Rock the Vote SB not actually being affiliated with Rock the Vote. They were apparently trying to undermine our votes in Isla Vista by convincing students that if they registered to vote in IV their car insurance would go up. When in reality because they know that our student population is mostly liberal and progressive, they want to sway our demographic by having us vote in our hometowns instead. In theory trying to disperse our votes elsewhere so that there aren't as many of these voters in IV. That kind of suppression and deception is unacceptable, and older generations wonder why we're so mad at them.
<br><hr>

I definitely agree that the intergenerational conversations are key to getting enough voters to turn things around. While political views tend to be solidified in a person's 20s, they are still malleable far after that. For instance, my grandparents were intensely conservative Catholics for many years, but in the past decade or so they have actually gotten far more liberal. This may be in large part due to the rest of the family, and also their surrounding community, getting more progressive (and more importantly, sensitive to the issue of climate change). Even if only 10% of these intergenerational conversations ends up succeeding in a changed vote, it would have a huge impact politically. 

      <br><br>

I also think it's interesting you mentioned that most people in power will never have to face the consequences of their actions. Corporations get many of the positive benefits of acting like an individual legally without much of the liability to the law that individuals have (corporations can be fined, but not put in jail). Most of the senate is over retirement age. We, however, are already beginning to live in a very different world that is suffering from the effects of climate change. Being a global issue, it will eventually creep to every corner of the planet, and it's been shown this week in the Post article that even the ultra-rich hillsides of Santa Barbara and Montecito are not safe. 

      <br><br>

What I took away from the video was similar to your first point: we have the knowledge, the desire, and motivation to make change happen, it's just a matter of breaking the inertia and status quo. We can take this issue into our own hands instead of throwing our hands in the air, proclaiming that the old and rich hold all the power in our country. Political apathy is a dangerous disease, and it's poison is especially potent in the wake of an issue like this.
<br><hr>
I agree with you many of the points you made. Climate change is a major issue in our generation; however, we are unable to make the necessary changes until we have the power to do so. The majority of the boomer generation has not realized how significant of an issue climate change really is. Some do not even believe it exists. It boggled my mind when I heard the excuses climate crisis deniers have come up with. It seems hypocritical when deniers of the climate crisis think that climate crisis does not exist because scientists are corrupt. The truth is, climate crisis deniers are corrupt because many of them are connect to the fossil fuel industry. It also surprised me when I found out that global warming was only the 18th out of 29 problems the world faces today among boomers. I can’t even think of 17 more issues that trouble our world. If global warming isn’t properly addressed, there will be no Earth to live on. Health care, economy, terrorism, and immigration problems will become irrelevant. I also find it ironic that the most denial is in the developed world when the developed world is the one that created the problem.
      <br><br>

I like the points you made about voting. We cannot wait for my generation to slowly come in power. I agree with you – the only way to out vote older generations is to influence them in the right direction. Families have the biggest influence on each other. The time to make a difference is more urgent than ever before.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with the majority of your statement. We, the younger generation, definitely need to "take control of the planet" if we want to curb the climate crisis. However, it is difficult for us to make changes due to the overwhelming influence of the older generation as well as our inability to take control, like you have mentioned. After watching both these lectures, I have come to realize that the strongest action we can take is to vote the people that are unwilling to solve the climate crisis, out. I wasn't surprised at all when Ken said that the strongest voting demographic is the older generation. Their views essentially control this country, as the people voted in reflect the older generation's apathy towards the climate issue. Our government is made up mostly by older people who will not live long enough to feel the most devastating effects of climate change, and I find it unfair that THESE are the people representing our country. 
      <br><br>

In 2020, we the younger generation must vote in droves if we want to make a change in this climate crisis. Like Ken mentioned in the video, we should convince 5 or more friends to vote and also convince our parents that climate change is a serious issue.
<br><hr>
I had a very similar response to this video when Professor Hiltner was talking about how our generation needs to take control and make a change. Not only was I thinking "then let us," I was also thinking "where do we even begin." I agree that voting is extremely important and is a good start to making a change with the climate crisis, but what are we going to do next. We of course need to get certain people out of office and replace them with people who care about such important issues such as this one, but that does not seem like enough. There is so much more to be done and the entire process of electing better officials and then creating policies and regulations and plans and then actually acting on them will take far too long. I also agree that we need to educate older generations about these issues, but limiting that education to our own family members is also not enough. Many families completely ignore the ideas of their younger family members because society teaches us that older people know more. I feel like we need some sort of system that is able to educate these older generations because they are the ones with the power and as history has shown us, they will continue to ignore our voices.
<br><hr>
I don't know what I was hoping for when I clicked on this video. A small part of me perhaps was hoping that Ken was going to magically fill us in on some secret action to take that would save the Earth, even though I know that doesn't exist. Still, faced with the overwhelming and complex issue of climate change, I can't help but wish for an easy solution or at least a sure solution that I, as an increasingly helpless feeling young adult and college student, could work towards. When Ken said "you need to take control of the planet," I was a little disappointed. "No kidding," was my first thought. I was even less excited when Ken pointed out some of the flaws in our democratic system and the fact that we can't afford to wait to grow up and then gain control of the world: when that's what I'm sitting in class and studying to try to do. I understand why you and other people our age would think that the only thing we can do to really take control is vote, but I am reminded of Greta Thunberg in this situation. Her protests and activism is making a difference and gaining lots of attention, and she is much younger than us. However, I am also reminded of a conversation I had with my stepdad about climate change where he brought her up and criticized her efforts. He said the opposite of Ken. While acknowledging the need for change and greener practices, he was the most upset about the audacity of a teenager skipping school to protest. To him, the place for young people who care about the environment and saving the Earth is in school: developing technology to mitigate the crisis and studying for future solutions. I told him that the two are not mutually exclusive things. I can still go to class and learn in order to contribute to climate crisis solutions one day while also protesting and participating in social and cultural changes. However, it is hard to know which is more effective or if either truly can be.

<br><hr>
I also agree with what you're saying. The few that are in power who will see the effects of the climate crisis are worried about it and are trying to address it one way or another but the older generation just doesn't care enough because why would they? At this point all that they can see is the short term. And the rest of us are going to have to deal with whatever they deem fit. We do need to vote and educate our loved ones on what the most important things are when it comes to voting. However should all else fail, we must not forgot the teachings of our hero Karl Marx. Down with the bourgeoisie... by any means necessary.
<br><hr>

As you said, it is frustrating that our current leaders are all old enough to have been responsible for the brunt of the climate crisis, yet will not experience most of its consequences. Young people must show up and vote the older generation out of office because younger people tend to care more about climate change. As you mentioned, younger CEOs and politicians are the ones more likely to pursue change that may appear radical to the older generation but is in fact what we need to try to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. 

      <br><br>

I also agree that it is important that young people speak to their older relatives who may not realize how terrible the effects of the climate crisis will be or who may not connect these effects with the fact that their descendants will be profoundly impacted. Hopefully, through increasing turnout, voting in younger politicians, and convincing older generations of the severity of the climate crisis, we will be able to make some progress towards saving our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree that it is very important for people of our generation to vote and to spread our knowledge of climate change to the older generations; however, this is easier said than done. I was recently talking to a friend and he mentioned his mom was working on a campaign for a woman that him and his family truly believed in. She ended up losing to a man who he described as corrupt and he said "Now I don't vote because that made me realize that my vote will never be enough". I think a lot of the time those in our generation feel a little hopeless about getting any kind of control of the planet, especially in a political system run by those much older than us who see us as naive kids. 
      <br><br>

I think the best thing that I learned from these lectures is that 2/3 of the older generations are voting while only 1/3 of us are. Spreading this knowledge is very important to show our generation that we actually can have power if enough of us work together.
      <br><br>

I also realized that even though I feel that my parents are pretty aware of the climate crisis and try to be as sustainable as they know how to be, there is still a lot that I have learned that I can share with them. We recently got solar panels because my grandpa was very into sustainability, so I think it is cool to note that some people from older generations can also spread their knowledge.
<br><hr>

I agree, voting is a key step to mitigating the climate crisis. We have the power to choose the people who make decisions in our country. I feel that people think that only the presidential election matter. This is not true. We also need bigger voter turn outs for local and state elections. Every single vote matters regardless of the election.
      <br><br>

I also believe that we need to take more action with educating the public. In a previous film, I learned that President Obama was once against gay marriage. However, he later changed his opinion because of public opinion and legalized gay marriage. The same can happen with climate change. The more people that realize how significant of an issue climate change is, the more likely others will be willing to follow.

<p>
What I found so powerful about Ken’s lecture this week was how he directly called out our generation, calling us to action.  He is using facts and powerful images to supplement his justification about why we should be mad about the issue that was so nicely handed to us from the past generation.  
      <br><br>


The images that I found most powerful to me as an audience member and as someone in Generation Z were the ones of other, less developed countries and the effects that our actions have fatally had on them. I think that the most powerful tool for getting people to act is not showing them what their actions are doing to themselves, but to innocent people.  It works to make us hold the past generation accountable so that we are not responsible for the death of our planet and the lives of so many people who did not do anything wrong.  

      <br><br>

Moreover, the other video offers us real life solutions that we can begin implementing today.  The two together work well to get us heated about the issues at hand, and then offering us answers to a lot of our questions.  This takes away any excuses about whether to act or not by giving us no other option-- we either act now, or experience the catastrophic consequences to our actions in our lifetimes.

I also found Ken's lecture very powerful, and makes we want to have these conversations with my parents, and sibling. As much as it sucks that we have this issue to deal with, it is our turn to create change for the futures of ourselves and marginalized communities. I think that Ken mentioning that youth movements create pressure and cultural change makes me inspired and hopeful that we have a shot at undoing what has been done. Although for some of us, having these conversations with parents may not be the easiest, it is very important to at least try. It is difficulty obviously because our parents come from a different generation, and were raised different. However, it is our responsibility to attempt at teaching them what we can. As stated in "Why the generation that caused the climate change crisis is not acting" lecture, this denial and delay issue of the climate crisis is a  generational issue therefore us doing what we can to convince older folks can create a  huge impact as Ken stated. Another thing that Ken mentioned that made me enthusiastic was that reinventing western culture is a solution. Although that may seem so hard to even comprehend or envision, it's exciting regardless to see that their is the smallest ounce of hope for us. What is frustrating however is that Western culture as Ken stated has sold our current lifestyle to the world, making it that much harder to try to change.


<br><hr>
I agree that Ken's presentation of climate injustice, the climate crisis situation, and then how we can begin helping the climate crisis was effective in moving the audience to want to mobilize to solve our situation.  However, I did not think that Ken's suggestions for how to help the climate crisis was radical at all like he said it would be.  In fact, I found them as conservative.  He tells us to take control of the planet by means of voting, youth rebellions, and child-to-parent inter-generational learning, all of which are means that have been used and have been successful before, so I would call these solutions conservative because they are suggestions that we have used in the past.  But the problem we face is one that we have failed time and time again to solve.  Environmentalists have constantly lost battles against the greedy opposition throughout history, losing habitats, species, forests, and costly damages from natural disasters.  We face a very new and daunting challenge, one that I would think requires a new and daring solution.  
      <br><br>


I think Professor Ken Hiltner needs our help in finding new, creative solutions to fight the climate crisis.  He has done so much to teach us our situation, it is now our turn to give him our feedback, and to debate which solutions would be most effective. An example of a possible new innovative solution is to take advantage of the new forms of technological communication: the media.  The process of transmitting information instantaneously can be just one of the ways in which we can spread environmental awareness and to give our side momentum in creating a lasting movement in our battle against climate change.

<br><hr>
I agree that Ken directly calling out our generation to act was powerfully important. Yes, it was largely the fault of older generations, but this is still our planet. I know many people who are angry about a variety of issues but who refuse to act on any of them because it was not their fault so they don't feel responsible to act--they instead yell and get angry at the people at fault. While I certainly understand this mindset and in a perfect world, the people at fault should be the ones who fix their problems. However, we don't live in a perfect world and the above is therefore a highly irresponsible attitude. And if our generation doesn't take immediate and drastic action to mitigate the climate crisis, we will soon become the older generation who contributed to the crisis while doing nothing to solve it at a time where we could have (assuming that the planet can support future generations). From Gen Z to fellow Gen Z, please don't let us turn into Boomers. 

<br><hr>
I completely agree that this lecture was especially powerful because he called out our generation directly, but he was not calling us out in a negative way. It was more of a "I have hope that you can accomplish what needs to be done, so let me give you a push in the right direction" way. The fact that Ken has this much faith in us makes me want to do better, obviously for the sake of the planet and the human race, but also because I want to prove him right. Our generation can and will push this planet back in the right direction. 


</span></div><hr>


<p>
The most intriguing part of the video was when Ken advised us( viewers) to act now. There are multiple ways one can incorporate sustainability changes in their lifestyle.  An example of this can be translated into your diet. As of today, I will not contribute to methane emissions anymore. By this I mean I will stop eating any meats. In class, we have been taught that methane is possibly the most dangerous greenhouse gas and is the majority emitted by the beef industry. Now, I will have to find a way to exclude meat out of my diet despite being eating meat my entire life. However, the benefits this will provide to the environment will outweigh my cravings. 

      <br><br>

Going back to what Ken said, during lectures and video we can acknowledge that our past generations have put us in this very situation. Not only that, but they continue to deny such a  climate crisis exists. Seeing that our past generations are not going to do anything to change our future, this new generation must act now. Ken goes over various ways one can be environmentally responsible and considerate. The challenge is now upon our current generation to find compassion in each one of us to save the planet from becoming uninhabitable before it's too late.

I think it is really cool that you are taking the initiative to help eliminate the methane emissions. If we had more people like you make small changes to their lifestyles, we may begin to lessen our effects. I am aware that it is virtually impossible to ask everyone to eliminate meat and dairy from their diets, but even if people choose to lessen their meat intake and replace it with more fruits and vegetables, we could make a big difference. I also have been actively trying to eliminate meat and dairy from my diet, and I have noticed that it is often really hard to find vegan options at places I am eating. As a society, I believe there are more and more people choosing to be vegan or vegetarian, but many restaurants still do not serve food catering to these diets which makes it appealing for many people. I have noticed this issue the most while eating in the dining hall. I do believe that UCSB does a good job providing vegan options, but I think they should be more widespread. Last week Ortega dining hall had a meatless monday where they served vegan and vegetarian food only all day. I think that if these types of things took place more often, people would be more open to trying meat alternatives and not relying on meat for every meal.

I agree that the most wonderful part of this video is giving suggestions; it means there is hope to save the Earth and it is not too late to start now. Personally speaking, I truly want to do something to improve our living environment, but I can hardly find an effective way. These big companies or government decisions are far away from me and is definitely beyond my power. After watching this video, I learned there are so many options even though my generation is not take charge of the planet. As an international student, I can not vote, but I can change my living habits and influence people around me. Actually, a week ago. I was thinking about brought a car and rent a house off campus next year. For now, I decide not to buy a car and choose a nearby location so that I can take the bus to the university instead of driving the car. In that case, I won't produce extra CO2 in the air. Additionally, I decide to tell my friends who didn't take this course as well as my parents the truth of climate change. I believe many people take no actions because they don't know how serious the situation is. In fact, I used to be the same as many before I took ENGL23. Thus, I am sure after telling people around me, they will be aware of the problem and do something. Just as the saying goes: many a little makes a mickle, all the ting effort we made will eventually show its great power to the world.

I really appreciate your act of giving up eating meats. It's not only limited to changes in diet but a greater step towards living a environmentally-friendly lifestyle.  Just as professor Ken has suggested in the video that it's this moment, at this time, we need to take actions today even though we are not the root cause of this great catastrophe. I agree with your discussion about the challenge our generation is facing and must react to. Voting is a direct way for us to contribute our own power to a global issue. Besides this, we can also take some small acts such as ride bikes to class everyday instead of driving. This not only alleviates the traffic and air pollution, but also helps us get exercise which college students are usually lack of. Another idea that strikes me the most is the child to parent intergenerational learning. Since climate crisis is a generational issue, it's better for both the generations to contribute to facilitate the situation and communication between parents and kids is a much easier way. This communication approach is more accessible and easier to succeed as there is a intimate relationship between the partners. Overall, it's compulsory for us to take the responsibility and be the host of our own planet. I'm curious to learn about simple acts we can do in order to prevent the climate crisis from getting worse.

<br><hr>
I also think that it's really cool that you are taking action to be more conscientious of your actions that may contribute to climate change. It's great that more and more people are becoming vegan or vegetarian for this reason, but I think it can also be really hard for people to make these changes because it's a change in your lifestyle, not just a one time thing. For example, people who live in poverty often don't have the choice to choose, for instance, between an electric car vs gas, or they can't afford to have a vegan diet or buy more expensive, alternative products that advertise sustainability, etc. We need to make sustainable products more accessible to everyone if we want to make a massive change in our consumer culture.

Taking meat out of your diet is a great way to take immediate action. For many the concept of "taking action" can be frustrating and even confusing as we wait for voting season to come. However, cutting down on beef and dairy is a choice we can make every day, and it's a choice I strongly urge everyone to make. Since I've started making a serious effort in cutting down on beef, I've come across many tasty alternatives, just at my local Albertson's. Living in a place like Santa Barbara has made the transition especially easy for me; the first time I tried to cut meat out of my diet was back in middle school. Unfortunately, I was dependent on school lunches, and the vegetarian options were sorely lacking in anything that could be considered appetizing. 

      <br><br>

That being said, voting is so important for us. Older people tend to be the ones who have the most free time on their hands because they're retired or have secure jobs that allow them to leave at times convenient for getting to the polls. It is our responsibility to make sure our voices are heard as well.

A plant based diet can go a long way and I applaud you for taking initiative even if it’s something as small as a change in diet. I have also centered my lifestyle around meat and dairy, as I come from a Hispanic family that serves beef and cheese on a daily basis. Cutting meat out of my diet is no easy task, therefore I have focused on limiting my intake to once or twice a week. Eventually, I plan on cutting meat entirely out of my diet but for now I’m going to ease into it. As for kens lecture, he hit it right on the money. We need to be better, Gen Z and millennials have the power to turn the tides with one simple task, voting. Kens proposition is something each of us should take and run with. We need to vote leaders into office who put the climate crisis as their number 1 priority rather than these loser boomers who care more about immigration policies than the well being of their grandchildren. Maybe I’m overly optimistic, or maybe it’s kens videos hyping me up, but I feel pretty Damon confident that together we will save our planet from becoming uninhabitable

In the last 60 years, ¾ of the CO2 that’s causing the climate crisis was emitted. Even though an older generation holds a great responsibility for this cause, we can be the ones to help clean up their mess. Let’s not treat it as a low priority like the generation that intensified the issue is doing, let’s be different and let’s do better. During the video, Ken mentions things we can to mitigate the climate crisis. These things range from activism, engineering sweeping, cultural change through decisions that we make on where we live, how we get around, what we eat, what we wear, the stuff we buy, etc. However I’m not quite familiar with the term “engineering sweeping” in the context of this climate crisis, so I’m hoping someone can please clarify this for me. As for the other things on the list it makes complete sense on how these things factor into climate crisis. If any of you guys are unsure of how things we can buy or even the things we wear can factor into the climate crisis, I highly suggest taking a quiz to find out your ecological foot (footprintcalculator.org) and seeing just how many earths it would take to live how you currently do. On this quiz you can click more details to be more specific with each answer you give and for a more accurate result.

Ken mentions that fossil fuel interests and others are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to undermine the power of democracy. However, it feels as if the age group from 18-29 is already undermining the power of democracy by not having that much voting participation in elections. It’s important to note that political change is important, even on the local level, if we want to fight against climate crisis and have solutions installed into our government system. One of the easiest ways we can spark this political change is by voting, and urging our friends to vote. Although in the 2018 midterm elections voting participation increased extremely for the 18-29 age group, it only rose to be about one third. This frightens me on how many people from this age group would actually vote before this midterm. Meanwhile, ⅔ of people in the age group of 65+ are voting, thus, in a way, making their voicing matter more. They have more influence because of the lack of participation in the other age group. But those of us in the age group of 18-29 can take some of our power back and increase our voting participation, let’s make our voices heard. People who are 65+ are deciding to make the climate crisis a low priority because it’s a low priority for them, because let’s be honest, not to sound morbid or anything, but they will probably be dead by the time the intense impacts of the climate crisis would come up. However our generation will be here, so why are we treating it as a low priority when it quite literally will affect OUR lives, not to mention the lives of future generations. Realistically, our generation can’t do it alone, we’re going to need the help of the older generations. As mentioned in the video, we can promote collective action, for example, child to parent intergenerational learning. This means the transfer of knowledge attitudes or behaviors from children to parents, in other words, we would teach our parents by communicating to them the horrific severity of this problem. For instance, we would explain to them how important this is for our future and their unborn grandchildren, as well as the family’s later generations. By doing this, we would have a direct personal approach to tackling the issue of climate change.

I find it very interesting how you said that the younger generation needs to find a way to take over the world as soon as we can. While I agree with you it seems like a very daunting task, both due to the time restraint and the scope of this issue, and I am interested to see you elaborate more on how you think this can be accomplished. I think that because our government is dominated by the older generation who does not see climate change as a priority at all, it is very difficult for the young population to persuade these people to create effective policies. It is both sad and infuriating that even though the US signed the Paris agreement, we still have not made the progress we need, and the temperature is actually rising 5 times faster now than it was when this agreement was signed. It makes me extremely angry that no matter how hard we try to convince them, the older generations who caused this problem seem not to be swayed. They do not seem to care that they are destroying the world for the sake of their wealth and convenience. I think it will be very beneficial for us to learn methods of intergenerational learning, because it seems that the generation above us is no longer doing the educating, and they are in need of some eye opening knowledge. I have tried again and again to tell my mom the causes of climate change, the consequences, and how she can help, but she just does not think of it as a priority. For the longest time she refused to give up plastic water bottles. I finally sent her a long paragraph about why this is hurting the planet and that I would really love if she tried to become more sustainable for me as well as multiple articles explaining the consequences of disposable plastics and SHE LEFT ME ON READ. It is so frustrating to pour your heart out to people and show them how passionate you are about something and then they either try to change the subject, or ignore you, and argue with you. I am done having people change the subject, and I am done with these old farts not caring about the life that they are destroying (no offense).

 I see what you mean when you feel like it’s such a daunting and overwhelming task for us to take action when we have little to no power. As you stated, the government is still dominated by people of previous generations, therefore their beliefs and political stances are currently in full effect. Even if we speak out about it through protests and social media outlets, we’d only be creating noise. Noise is better than nothing, of course, but there’s nothing that is ACTIVELY coming out of that. I do think it’s important to spread awareness as people are not taking it seriously. However, at the end of the day, our lifestyles have only turned out the way that they are because of the resources that have been given to us. Unfortunately, easy access to these resources have furthered this crisis. As a result, millions of people in Generation Z have become accustomed to this lifestyle, whereas people with leader positions are in no hurry to recognize or even mitigate this situation. Ken’s suggestions of making small-scale lifestyle changes are definitely useful. Oftentimes, people think that doing so won’t stop the production of greenhouse gas emissions. So... will making these changes successfully achieve an overall effect? We won’t know until we take some sort of action.
<br><hr>
I couldn’t agree more with you that the call to action feels like a daunting task. I do appreciate Ken stating in his video that we have to take over the world as soon as possible, because it’s true, but I just don’t know if we can do it in time. There are so many old white men in politics (not you Bernie, we love you) who are doing their very best to stay in power as long as possible, that sometimes it feels like there are only so many protests I can go to before the effort begins to feel fruitless. Despite this hopeless feeling, I am trying to stay hopeful, and I hope everyone else can do the same, and better.  

      <br><br>

In addition, I can relate to your issue with your mom about the plastic water bottles. While my family is pretty aware of ways to work towards better sustainability (my dad is an environmental chemist), the one thing they won’t seem to budge on is meat. I am not a vegetarian, but I do tend to steer clear of meat when I can, and almost never purchase beef. However, no matter how many times I bring the facts to the table, and even include health concerns that can come with eating a lot of red meat, they still cook burgers and steaks when I come home for the breaks. Reading other people’s success stories with their parents has given me hope though, and I think I need to start trying a bit harder to really get them on my side.

In the lectures of this week, Ken has told us that due to the ignorance towards climate problems in his generation, my generation must take action now from suffering more from the global climate crisis. A terrifying data has been given to us that nearly 75% percentage of carbon dioxide has been put into the atmosphere in the past 6 decades. Yet, due to the time delay, the effect of the climate crisis didn’t show up until the recent decade. The true “murderer” generation who were supposed to undo all the harm they have done to the following generations and to the earth, on the contrary, denied climate crisis is really here, around us. So, we, on behalf of the new generation, were pushed to the front line to undo all the harm, saving us all from the disaster. Also inspired by today’s lecture, climate issues really are not political-related. It is not only a Left-wing-thing, yet it is a whole-human-beings-related thing. We all come as a whole. We thrive or die out as a whole in regard to climate change. If we don’t do something, we will have no chance to do so as time passed out, since every year, the situation is much worse.

The most compelling argument made in my opinion is the child to parent communication that was mentioned. This has the most effective impact whilst being a very accomplishable goal. Luckily my parents are very aware of the climate crisis. extending this tactic a would recommend talking to your peers about it. Only a fraction of UCSB students takes this course which leaves us with the question hom many of our peers stay uninformed. I try to speak up whenever I see friends of mine acting in a way that can easily be changed for the better. 
      <br><br>
As for taking power my first instinct is to say that this should be a long term goal. However the video makes it very clear that there is no such things as 'long term', we should act now. I think we should take power in ways we know best. Historically seen this is via protests and rebellions. Translate this to the new era and you have online petitions, hashtags , vlogs and what not. Let us as the younger generation use our 'expertise' to cause some change regarding the perception of the climate crisis.

<p>

Upon watching these two lecture videos I was able to gain a deeper and more thorough understanding towards the issue of climate change in terms of why the generation that is mainly responsible for causing climate change does not take actions to mitigate this issue and how the future generations can remediate and alleviate the climate crisis. One point that Ken pointed out during his lecture that was very true and significant in answering the first part of the question, or why the baby boomer generation did not promptly take actions to address climate change during their time, is the strange yet interesting time delay in the consequences of anthropogenic climate change. In simpler words, there was this delay in the occurrence of the negative impacts of climate change caused by humans actions during the generation that was principally responsible for triggering climate change with their intense exploitation and depletion of the natural resources and the unrestrained burning and use of fossil fuels that contributed an enormous amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Following this sense, since the baby boomer generation did not really feel much of the consequences of climate change that they had caused themselves, they were less likely to take actions to address it in the past and they are even less likely to address it now because they are not primarily affected. 
      <br><br>
Additionally, the public poll results Ken mentioned in the first lecture video regarding how the older parental generations perceive and rank climate change among other issues are really effective examples to support his argument associated with the time delay. I was surprised by the poll results but after listening to Ken’s explanation on why the poll results are the way they are, I began to see the reason and motives behind the voting trends among the older generation. The older parental generation does not see climate change as an urgent, pressing concern contrary to the generation of their children and grandchildren because they have not felt the direct impacts of the climate crisis. Therefore, they are more concerned with topics on social security, health care, immigration reform, terrorism, border security, and other topics that are pertinent and more relevant to their lives. After all, the generation that initiated and should be held accountable for climate change would not be around long enough to experience its consequences; on the contrary, it would be their children, grandchildren, and all of their future descendants--even though they were not the ones causing climate change--to suffer the worst forms of negative impacts resulting from the anthropogenic climate crisis. 
      <br><br>
Lastly, although the power in modern society is still held in the hands of the older generation who induced climate change as Ken mentioned in both lecture videos, there are still ways for the newer generation to take action to address and raise awareness on the climate crisis. For instance, the protests and rallies organized by the youth organizations mostly in universities and college campuses can exert pressure on the politicians to listen to the needs of the youth and push for green and environmentally-friendly laws and policies. The idea of intergenerational learning sounds like a very interesting and appealing approach to me because I also think that communication between the parental and the children generations on climate change can effectively and more closely connect and bond the two generations together as the younger generation will help their parents to realize the urgency and dangers in the climate crisis they caused, and together the generations can help each other to provide practical solutions to address climate change, which is the ultimate goal of this idea.

<p>
After watching both lectures, I think I am getting closer and closer to the truth. I used to have a doubt that if the global warming issue is so bad, why we still do not believe it and why we do not take actions? The true answer behind that is we know the truth, we just do not take it. The political reasons, the economy reasons and the social reasons make people do not want to accept it. Who wants to care some issue in decades and sacrifice today's benefit? "Genius scientists can find solutions in the future and I can make money today." It is a sad fact that we know what is right and we keep doing the wrong things. And just like the professor pointed out these people are still going to be in charge for a long time. 

      <br><br>

I strongly agree that we as the younger generations who tend to care more about this issue, we need to take actions. If they do not take actions, we have to otherwise no one will take actions. By all ways we can do, things are easy and everyone knows it. Turn off the lights, ride bikes, stop wasting food and so on. We all know these things, but we just think they are too tiny to do or myself is not significant enough so why bother. It is not true. If everyone thinks like this, all these little points will add up to a big bad consequences.

I agree with your points. There are times in my own life when I think that a small act cannot do anything because I was only thinking of myself. However, you are right in saying that we must consider everyone else as well. We are stronger in numbers and if we all had this mindset, nothing would ever get done. I think that if we all start small and start somewhere, we can achieve a lot more than if we give up straight away. Small change is still some change. Also, it is saddening that we, as young people, can only do so much when most of the people in power are those who do not advocate for eco-friendly policies that could benefit out earth. In the near future, we should see more people of power who can do impactful things to help the earth. But, it is still unfortunate to see as it is uncertain on how long we have to wait for this change to occur.

<p>
Any actions taken for a good and positive approach should not be indecisive. Nowadays, plenty of political issues stand on different perspectives. More and more rebellions appear on the streets just to change the policy or gain rights people seek to have. And these protests or rebellions mostly end up successfully or few changes might be made. This proves that youth movements actually have a portion of possibility to make things happen and motivate new thoughts. 

      <br><br>

In the lecture, Ken points out that we have to communicate with our parents about how the climate crisis is now an extremely important problem that has to be solved immediately. I agree with this saying in which he’s addressing how past generations, who cannot do something to make changes to the current world, put effort and hope into our generation. I also believed that voting can absolutely influence one another to truly think about what they should do to positively and effectively help our uninhabitable earth.

I believe your statement of how my generation needs to “take control of this planet” and having to start now is very important because I feel as though many people that I know often are worried about climate change and discuss the ways they can help the planet but constantly put their efforts off for “tomorrow.” Most of the reasons I hear people from my generation use to explain why they are putting their efforts off for “tomorrow” is because they believe we have no political power to change anything in the systems that are in place today. However, as you stated, we do have the power to make a change but only one-third of us are actually taking control of that said power. Sure, we may not all be ready to become a member of congress or create movements to educate others about the severity of climate change but we can all express our concerns by voting so that collectively our voices are heard and understood. In addition, voting is an easy task that takes some research to see how you would like to vote then no more than thirty minutes to register to vote and to physically vote. Voting is one of the things we all should be doing.

      <br><br>

On the topic of child to parent intergenerational education, I agree and disagree to certain extents. I agree that we as children can have a great impact on our parents in educating them about climate change and how we can help. My generation has access to knowledge regarding climate change through things such as our education systems and feeds on our social media accounts and can transfer this knowledge to our parents through conversation. However, as someone who has parents who are baby boomers (yes I know the age difference between my parents and I is crazy but it is not super uncommon), it can feel as though I am speaking to a brick wall due to how inflexible they are with their own judgments and ideas. Often times, when I discuss the types of classes I take here at UCSB, such as Climate Crisis 101 or Representing: Queer Communities of Color in Traditional and Digital Media, they usually express disgust in the sense that they are paying for me to take “usual” and “useless” classes. Since they already check out mentally whenever I mention the titles of these classes, the information that I bring up that could impact their views on how bad of a situation Climate Change is right now just go in through one ear and out the other.

I completely agree with your statement on the importance of voting and the potential power our generation holds in politics today. The ability to vote was given to us for a reason, and it’s saddening to see that so many of us are not taking advantage of this voice we have in important political decisions. As you said, not all of us are ready to become a member of Congress or take huge political stances, but there should be nothing stopping us from voting. Voting is both easy and immensely powerful, and for only ⅓ of our generation to exercise this right is wrong. Given that we are not yet of age to hold high political power, we should be doing everything we can in attempts to sway political decisions, and therefore some of the long-term effects we have on the environment. It gives me hope that our generation had a higher voter turnout, but also that many more people closer to my age actually have the opportunity to vote in the upcoming presidential elections. The youth of America seems to be unified in their stance on the climate crisis, which makes voting essential in having any sort of voice in today’s politics.
<br><br>
I feel very lucky that my parents are so open to listening to the things I feel and learn about our climate, and I can’t even imagine how frustrating it must be for you to express your opinions on this (unfortunately) challenging subject. Both of my parents are conscious about being eco-friendly, and sometimes they will admit fault and ask me how they can change their potentially destructive habits. Through this, I feel as if the information and knowledge I have surrounding this topic are essential; if they had never asked me about certain things, they could have easily gone about the rest of their lives doing things that damage our planet even further. When I learn something about the climate crisis that I feel is important for them to know, I often send them the articles or explain it to them myself. I know that they could find the information on their own, but I often feel as if it is my responsibility to relay my knowledge to them, because they might understand the urgency of the situation more if the information is coming from their own daughter. This child-parent education is extremely important, and the connections we make with older generations could prove to be vital in solving the problem of climate change denial.


<br><hr>

Child to parent intergenerational learning is an interesting method mentioned by Ken. By educating your parents you increase the influence that our generation has on the world. It is important to make sure they are educated on climate change and what that pertains to. That being said, I can see how in situations like yours it would be difficult to achieve this. Even though it may seem like talking to a brick wall I would encourage you to not give up on trying to educate them on climate change and whatever contemporary beliefs you have. 
<br><br>


Ken’s call to action to our generation sticks out to me from this week's lecture video. It is not just about being educated. We must be proactive in trying to combat this issue. That means continuously trying to educate others as well as trying to demand real change from our government. Voting is a key aspect of this. It is important to vote and encourage your peers to vote too.

The biggest reason the past generations have not accepted climate change as a priority issue is because of denial, due to the time delay. One of the arguments that frustrates me the most is when people argue it is not caused by humans, but instead is a natural cycle of climate. We all know that scientific evidence and reason rejects their denial that climate change is not an issue. The well-known reason warming is accelerating more rapidly than it ever has, is due to CO2 released from human emissions. Denying this evidence is just ignorant. I think the reason why people of this generation force themselves into denial is because they have developed a pretty set lifestyle over the last 60 years and know that this consumerism lifestyle would have to change in order to offset climate change. Our generation is more prompt to care and is more accepting to change our lifestyle, because we know if we don’t we will be facing the severe consequences. I found it interesting that as each generation gets younger they consider global warming as more of an important issue. It shocked me to see that people 75+ considered it the 23rd problem out of 29 and baby boomers ranked it 18/29. For me, I would say climate change is the number 1 issue I am concerned about, and I think a lot of people in my generation would agree. 
<br><br>

Our generation needs to take control of political power to bring about change, because without the power and legislation to regulate people and business it is too hard to get everyone to act on climate change instead of based on their own self interest. Unfortunately I think it is unlikely that our generation will gain a significant amount of political power in the next few years because of how many people are older than us that are likely to vote for older candidates. However with high young voter turnout, we could still make a difference by gaining more political power than if our generation did not vote as much. I think the comparison to the 60s and 70s youth rebellions for human rights is interesting because in this situation the youth did exert huge political pressure that eventually did lead to reform, so hopefully we can do the same. As Kennedy said “it is a time of danger and uncertainty but also a creative time”. Our future could be reinvented if our generation commits to bringing change in creative ways, that demand political change.

In Ken’s first lecture he highlights how his generation is largely in power and it doesn’t come as a surprise that the results of the poll showed that climate change was low on baby boomer’s list of concerns. Although it’s severely annoying hearing climate change deniers’ excuses, it’s also especially harmful when younger generations need all the help they can get to take steps towards a more sustainable future. If baby boomers and older generations can at least empathize with their kids and grandkids then they too can become a climate change activist even if they themselves won’t be around much longer. It’s heartbreaking to think that babies who aren’t even born yet will be born into an environment that’s deteriorating to no fault of their own. The whole situation is obviously just unfair especially because some younger generations who are aware of the climate crisis haven’t been able to vote until recently and in general, older adults are more likely to vote than younger people, however, this is changing. Because the effects of climate change seem so apparent, it’s aggravating to think that some older people are in fact aware, but choose to not prioritize the issue. I don’t understand why anything else (social security, taxes, terrorism) would be a concern if climate change permanently alters our state of living and our natural environment.

I agree strongly with the fact that my generation should be the ones to take over because many people of older generations are not willing to do anything about the climate crisis. You mentioned that the average age of congress was 60. A lot of these members of congress have been in office for many years. This means those who are deniers will keep their vote on legislation, preventing anything that would help the climate crisis. This brings up the topic of term limits for congress members. I personally believe there should be term limits on congress members to avoid one person influencing legislation for many years. This may block large companies from being in legislature's pockets as they would have to lobby more frequently and my have a difficult time lobbying younger generations as they may not agree with the company's work like the older generation did. Also this will allow for younger people to hod office because a lot of the older politicians will no longer be able to.  Unfortunately congress will never pass legislation that would keep them from holding office until they pretty much die. Having a younger legislature will also help better reflect the future as a majority of whats being passed now is being voted on by people that will not feel the consequences. As Ken mentioned we do need to act now because we do not have time to reach our 60's to do something. I believe if we want to fix this planet we need to start with our own government because we could set an example for other countries and set the standard for what needs to be done.

What struck me the most from Professor Hiltner's lecure was when he stated that we needed to communicate to our parents about the horrifics of climate change and have them act on it. I couldn't help but think about the privilege it takes to be able to communicate to your parents on a deep level like that. My parents are immigrants who speak proficient English, and despite how much I want to educate them on this issue, I am simply not able to. It is difficult for me to explain such complex ideas in my mother tongue-- I feel sad that our language barrier is to large for me to overcome despite how much I want to share my knowledge with my parents. I hope to find articles or videos in my mother tongue to share with my parents but I do recognize that the country my parents originate from completely disregards climate change. 
<br><br>

 I want to acknowledge that the ability to fully grasp the concept of climate change is a big privilege. In addition to possible language barriers that may prevent one from being educated about climate change, American capitalism has consumed our citizen's time and interests, leaving very little room to care about environmentalism in general. This environmental problem is largely a social problem-- Professor Hiltner is right. We must take action to enforce policies and encourage our peers to be proactive.

In response to your comment, I too was intrigued when Ken said we had to communicate all the horrific issues to our parents to make a difference. I related to this comment because my parents aren’t english speakers and it’d be rather difficult to try to explain why activism in climate change is so important to them. Another difficulty would be finding the time to speak to them as they work all day and a conversation educating them on the climate crisis would be quite complex and probably time consuming as neither of them surpassed elementary school as children.
<br><br>
When watching this video, I found myself thinking of how great it would be if the older generations joined the younger activists and thought that somebody should be educating the older generations as they’re educating us now. When Ken said it should be us that do it, it was kind of a slap in the face. It made sense, but I didn’t understand why it was so hard for me to come to terms with it until I made the connection of how hard it’d be to get my own parents to understand this. There’s so many obstacles in the way - such as American capitalism, time, and language barriers - but somebody has to step up and try to overcome them. In order to save ourselves from mass extinction, it’s at least worth a shot.
<br><hr>

I understand your difficulty to communicate the climate crisis as some of my relatives simply deny its existence in its entirety, which makes it extremely hard to have a discussion on the topic, even if my intent is educational. Unfortunately with time these relatives will see the changes more dramatic. 
<br><br>
Your point that understanding and fully grasping the concept is a privilege when it comes to the effects of capitalism is true and we need to encourage this recognition as a stance against these big industries instead of falling into their traps.

<p>
As I was analyzing the actions that we must take to the issue of climate change I was attempting to figure out which strategy that Ken mentioned outweighs the other? Which one seems like the better option? The answer to that is that they're all equally important because they all contribute to fixing our crisis. You shouldnt only focus on one strategy, we must all attempt to take action as best as we could, keeping our options open. 
<br><br>
 But I would like to specifically discuss one strategy that Ken mentioned which was voting. I like to believe that I am a rather politically involved activist. I believe that we live in a democracy that needs to undergo a series of changes whether those changes fall under women's rights, LGBTGQ+ rights, our education system, etc… and in this case, our environmental system. I constantly preach that in order for us to see a change, we need to vote. So when Ken mentioned that the simplest way to fix our crisis was to go out and vote, I couldn't agree more. There are so many of us who have the privilege to vote but yet many aren't taking advantage of it. How do we expect to see change if no action is taking place? If the shoe fits for you, why aren't you using YOUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT to vote for the greater good?  From my experiences, I constantly hear “my vote doesn’t even matter” or “our voting system is flawed so there's no point” from those who do not vote. I disagree. Every single vote does indeed matter and if you don't vote then your voice will never be heard and closed mouths do not get fed.

The most impressive part of the lecture video “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” is where professor Hiltner talked about the polls suggesting how voters at different age groups rank climate crisis as a prior problem among 29 in total. It was surprising for me to see that voters in the 60s, 50s, and 40s rank climate change as the 23rd, 18th, and 15th out of the list of 29 problems, including social security, education, etc. However, the trend is quite predictable to me: the older people are, the less front climate change is on their priority list. This is extremely heartening because as more people are being aware of the climate crisis, those who are really in power are not placing importance on this issue. On the other side, I think that no matter what, teaching the younger generation about climate change is still an important way to make change because one day people in power will be people in  our generation, and when that happens, maybe the poll results will show climate crisis being on the top of the priority list of voters. 
<br><br>


In the lecture video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis”, Professor Hiltner mentioned another important action we should start to make as soon as possible: voting. This way of “taking control of the planet” through a political power is sort of ironic to me because last week we just saw a movie “Before The Flood”, within which the mayor of Miami stressed the importance that climate change should never be a political issue because no matter it’s republican or democrat who is in charge, the sea level IS still going to rise anyways. It is itself a paradox that the major method to solve climate change is through giving the political power to someone who places great concern and promise of actions, while the climate change is not supposed to be determined by politics. Another thing that I strongly agree with Professor Hiltner is that the personal influence we should all take on, teaching and convincing our parents, kids in the future, and any other family members and friends about the severity of this problem. This is why all the lecture videos have been emphasizing so much on the nature of climate change— it is generational, meaning that the difference in attitudes affected whether people act or not hugely. Sharing this video to friends, for example, is a great way to spread awareness of this issue and solutions, and when the number of sharing is big enough, we know that we’re making a difference.

I definitely agree with you that it’s so predictable that older generations would rank climate change so low on their list of priorities. Why care about a crisis that is largely not going to affect them? This is why Ken’s solution of this young generation needing to take over the planet is so important. Our generation is uber-aware and very concerned about the effects that the climate crisis is going to have on our lives. We are the ones it is ultimately going to affect, and we need to put ourselves in a position to stop the crisis before it gets worse. If we don’t do it, no one else is going to.
 <br><br>
However, it is so difficult for us to gain this power because we require the backing of the entire population to do so, since that is how democracy functions. So, the intergenerational learning that Ken mentions is essential if we are to make any progress. As our parents educated us, we have to be the ones to start the conversations about climate change and ensure they are learning all the facts about our current situation. Not only does this younger generation need to vote, but we also need older generations to start voting for candidates that will do something to stem climate change, and see it as a top priority. Climate change needs to be a top priority for everyone. All our lives we consider ourselves. We need to start thinking about the generations that will come after us. We are responsible for leaving them a livable Earth. It is time we take the actions that will give them the Earth that we received.

I was very happy to hear that the youngest age group for voting showed up more than ever in our last polling. However, I was not as pleased to hear the fact that it was only 1 in 3 people and the 65+ age group, 2 of 3 people voted. It is so crazy that the oldest group is voting with double as much power as the youngest group, when they are not the ones who will have to live with the long term effects of what they vote on. Their concerns are not with saving the planet that will be in catastrophe after they are already dead. 
<br><br>


Also, I would like to address what you said about changing our culture and the idea that happiness is to be found in the things that we have. While I do not believe money is everything, it is ignorant to say that happiness isn't to be found in our material goods. Money and the things it can buy are absolutely able to make us happy and it should not be weird to say that. People in every socioeconomic class can gain happiness from material goods. 
<br><br>

Hand in hand with this, the consumer culture that you mentioned with this is also not in of itself a bad thing. Consumer culture is essential for a good economy, and the consumer culture we have right now has led us to live in one of the best economic periods for our country right now. What I would argue is not changing consumer culture as much as a culture of producing one-time or poorly made goods that become obsolete in a short period of time, leading to excess waste.

I agree with you in some ways on what you commented about, but I think that there absolutely has to be a shift in our consumer culture if we want to be a part of changing the climate crisis for the better.  Yes, I agree with you when you say that material goods can make people happy.  However I think it is less a problem of us purchasing things that increase our happiness, and more the excessive rates at which we do it.  Our popular culture and advertising media have led Americans to believe they can buy a solution to all of our problems.  While this may be true to people of a lower socioeconomic class, who do not have ready access to things many of us would take for granted, for the vast majority of Americans this is not the case.  Studies have shown that people making very little money compared to average do have increases in happiness as they start to make more.  However this stops at a point lower than you would expect with money not correlating with happiness much after the 70 grand income mark and falling drastically further on (https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/14/money-can-buy-happiness-but-only-to-a-point.html).  My point here is that many Americans have been falsely led to believe that more money and material possessions will always equal more happiness, and our society would be much better off emphasizing non material (and non climate crisis affecting) ways to achieve happiness.  You also mentioned how consumer culture is essential for a good economy.  But isn't focusing purely on the strength of our economy, looking only at the short term benefits it brought people while disregarding the future damage it will do what caused the crisis in the first place?  Unfortunately I believe that most Americans will be unwilling to make anything close to drastic changes in their lives and spending habits.  This is why it is so important that we stand up to climate change politically.  We (as in the average American) simply have too much to worry about in our daily lives to self regulate our behavior based off of a global problem that we individually cannot solve.  To change our society as a whole we have to fight politically to have ourselves, and more importantly large corporations supplying our individual spending habits, be regulated, as counter intuitive as that may seem.

I agree that the the lack of young voters in comparison to the older generations is a major issue, particularly if we want to "take control of the planet". The older generations are more likely to perpetuate the destructive practices that have landed us in the crisis we face today. Hopefully the increasing trend in young voters will continue. The younger generations are becoming more informed and can hopefully pass this knowledge on. Ken's point that we can't waste any time is very valid, as I fear we are doing too little too late. It is the lack of action we have seen so far that has helped this crisis worsen rather than be mitigated.
<Br><hr>

Thank you for pointing out the fact that money can buy happiness, as I believe this to be true to an extent. People should be able to spend money on things that satisfy their needs and make their life more comfortable. However, our current materialistic society has gone way past this goal. Americans spend insane amounts of money on things they don't need, and these objects often have a large carbon footprint from manufacturing or come heavily packaged. While I disagree with Ken saying that money can't buy happiness I agree with his underlying message: people need to live more within their means and seek happiness not in objects but in other avenues personal relationships and meaningful activities. As for voting, it is promising that young people are getting out to vote but it still isn't enough. Each and every one of us needs to register to vote and pressure our friends into doing so as well.

Upon watching these two videos I personally feel like the boulders on our generation’s shoulder has become much heavier and serious. It is very understandable how the older generation does not realize the gravity of climate change due to few devastating environmental related activities occurring in their lifetime. But I believe Professor Hiltner’s suggestion was something that I had never considered personally; if we were to convince our parents’ generation regarding the seriousness of climate change from an emotional level, it might actually be effective. Politicians like Trump does not believe in climate change, but what if his children do and they tried to convince him? Even though he might not directly adopt the suggestion, it would be in his consideration as his children are at stake from the harms of climate change. I really appreciate the effort Prof Hiltner has put into his videos providing us with reasons and solutions to global warming, as well as his positivity for us to seek for a new world.

I was really thinking about this question ‘besides feeling guilty, what suggestion will/can old generation provide new generation regarding how to protect the environment?’ because let’s face it: there are really a lot of Greta Thunberg and her news going on recently and a big number of old generation are feeling guilty. I was curious about besides this guilt, what do the old generation really think. Then tonight I open the syllabus and found out that the latest video my professor posts is addressing this question.
<br><br>
There are suggestions such as take control this planet, start protecting the Earth now, give as much impact on protecting the Earth as possible, explain to old generation that people should protect this planet, and, most interestingly to me, vote.
<br><br>
Okay…here is the fact (that I notice): prior and during the last election, the former president of United States, Obama, said for more than countless time, that ‘people, you should vote!!!’ He is a democrat, so he wants democrat to be the next president. He thought that the more people vote, the more chance democrats win. However, president Trump won. The majority chose Mr. Trump to be the president. Why president Obama misjudged the result?
<br><br>
Ironically, I remember that John Stewart has said that president Trump is neither democrat nor republican; his win can help the republican ‘make a fortune’.
<Br><hr>
I totally agree with your point and I, too, feel that a new, huge sense of responsibility and burden is expected upon us as the new, hopeful generation. However, we can only do so much and we only have so much power and influence especially in the modern world where the majority of sociopolitical power resides in the hands of the boomer generation and other older parental generations that were principally responsible for initiating climate change. As a result, here is where the suggestion of intergenerational learning comes into effect: we need to educate our parents and older generations on the horrific impacts of climate change that they are leaving on our planet and on ourselves that it is not an issue to joke around but rather an unfortunate harsh reality. Although the older parental generations did not personally directly feel the consequences of climate change, their children and future descendants will be. And I think this would be a major turning point in the attitude of the older parental generation in regards to climate change that if and once they have known that their actions are harming the environment and lives that their children and future descendants are dependent upon, they will gradually come out of the oblivion and ignorance of the issue and begin to look at it in a new light, to really consider the possible consequences of their actions on their children, and eventually to collaborate with us, their children and the younger generation, to help save our environment together.

<Br><hr>
I feel confident that if the new generation are willing to suggest the old generation to help save the Earth (actually this is not saving the Earth, it’s saving us), instead of Greta Thunberg blaming the old generation every day, we will make progress. The situation of the Earth will not become worse off more and more. We want to start make a difference now. We will educate our next generation to help protect this planet, or there will be a second younger Greta Thunberg blaming us for not protecting the Earth. If this happened, the supporter of the first Greta Thunberg may not feel good.

In Ken’s last lecture, he describes how his generation (baby boomers) are the generation who created the climate crisis in a single generation, but yet are the group that sees it as less of a big deal as the younger generations. During Ken’s lifetime CO2 emissions are increased greatly, due to his generation, but they still do not want to take action. This is not the case for millennials and generation z, many of the people within these generations want to take action and make change, and there are many ways about going about this, which Ken goes into describing. 
<br><br>

 In order to fix the climate crisis the younger generation needs to take control of the whole situation and start action now, we cannot wait for the Boomers to act; they have had their whole lives to act, but did not, and still do not. By control, Ken does not mean for humans to have more control over nature and the planet, but control on how we treat the planet, and with laws and regulations on how to do so. The younger generations need to get into political power, use their voices, or even something smaller like diet or biking. The most important thing for people to do to fix this planet is to vote, we need to continue to use our voices to put our input into government, and try and get the voting power out of the boomers. The boomers have 2:1 political power over younger generations because of their voting numbers, and they will not suffer in their lives with the climate crisis, but we will. There are so many things that new generations, and even old generations to mitigate the climate crisis. From really big things, like being a political figure, like in congress, to really small things like going to climate marches, reducing your meat intake, any many other small lifestyle changes. Big or small anything will benefit our planet and this climate, and it is time to take our planet back into our hands, and out of the boomers control.

I agree with everything you stated here. We cannot wait for others to take action in saving our planet as they have already failed to do so. However, we are often plagued with the sentiment "I'm only one person, what I do or don't do won't make that much of a difference in the grand scheme of things." While this is a valid thought, it boils down to simple laziness and and unwillingness to change for a problem bigger than ourselves. Like Professor Hiltner mentioned, we are a fossil fuel addicted society STILL in denial of its negative impacts and the danger we face because of this addiction. Simple acts such as carpooling, avoiding paper and plastic disposables, reducing meat intake, etc., when multiplied along 7 billion people, will have colossal effects. We get so upset at politicians and CEO's and world leaders not doing enough, while failing to ask if we ourselves are doing enough. It is an us problem just as much as it is a them problem and those of us aware of the crisis at hand must use our voting power, our voices, and our actions to help clean up the mess that those before us left. Our generation is not blameless nor are we solely responsible, but we are accountable for what happens next.

What really struck me in the last two videos was that individuals in Donald Trump’s age range ranked climate change as 23 out of 29 issues that needed to be addressed, and the baby boomers ranked it 18 out of 29 issues! If I were to be asked what my number one issue that need to be addressed today is it would hands down be the climate crisis. The other fact that really struck me was the statistic on voter turnout. The younger generation has 1 out of 3 people coming to the polls to vote, while the older generation that ranked the climate crisis very low on their list of priorities has 2 out of 3 people coming to the polls. That generation is also the generation that put 2/3 of the CO2 into the atmosphere in their generation. The older generation is leaving us with the consequences of them not taking action, but as Ken stated we can’t sit here in anger or waiting for the older generation to act. We, as the younger generation need to act. I have hope in us!
      <br><br>

            As professor Hiltner pointed out that the youngest women voted into the congress established the green new deal! We need to get up and speak out. We need to improve out voter turnout, so we are not at a disadvantage. We need to support our young leaders. We need to put the climate crisis as the number one priority on our list. The future can be turned around with our actions. 
<br><br>

            I really resonated with the idea of intergenerational knowledge. I was lucky to grow up in a household with parents that love and believe in the environment and protecting it. My dad would also come knock on the bathroom door when we were taking too long in the shower, He would insists that we bring our lunch baggies home and reuse them, I learned how to sort recycling at age six, I was told to avoid single use plastic as much as possible. Now that I am older and learning more about the crisis and the steps that we can take to reduce our impact I have learned new ways to reduce my impact. I became vegetarian, I have eliminated most single use plastic bags and invested in reusable bags, I really try not to buy products contain palm oil and buy bulk goods as much as possible. Through this process I have encourage my parents to do the same. At first they were very skeptical about becoming vegetarian and had a hard time eliminating items such as produce bags however just yesterday I received a picture of my dad holding all his produce in reusable bags, an email of their new favorite vegetarian dinner, and a message that their dinner conversation consisted of ways to eliminate meat from their diets. So, the point I am trying to make is that we as the younger generation can make an impact by showing what we support and believe in. The future is ours, so we have to stand up for our quality of life!

I was hoping that Ken's radical solution would be concrete. But when I heard that we need to "act now," and "take control of this planet," and not wait for someone else to solve the issue, I was actually really disappointed. I feel like everything that we are talking about in this class is so intangible, nobody is really saying how we can solve the climate crisis,  it's almost as if every time discuss the climate crisis, we just come up with slogan-like sayings that attempt to motivate change. I wanted to turn away from the video because of this. 

      <br><br>

That being said, I continued to watch and found some elements that are appreciated. I liked the encouragement to vote because it would be devastating to have another person in power that didn't prioritize climate change. I also greatly appreciated Ken's points on the effectiveness of child to parent intergenerational learning, or basically teaching the older generation the negative impact climate change is having on our own future. This seems like the most influential and viable approach that I've come across in the conversation of climate change. I think that we also have to continue to support movements like veganism and vegetarianism, and denounce a popular consumer culture by thrifting and teaching about how to think with a less materialistic mindset.

I found this comment to be very interesting and very telling. I have experienced the same trend when listening to many different people’s ideas on climate change: many times, the idea is simply that we must fight climate change. The way I see it, the main problem is that climate change will not be reversed until oil companies are forced to vastly cut down on their activities. To most people, that seems impossible for them to reach or affect. How is a person supposed to get all the way up to the great and powerful oil industry? In this video, Hiltner identifies several ways in which any normal person can make their impact. One of the most important is voting: Hiltner tells us to vote and tell five friends to vote. The effect this could have can not be overstated, considering that ⅔ of people 65+ voted in the most recent election while only ⅓ of the youngest voting group voted. Hiltner also highlights the fact that my generation can teach the next generation (the easiest and simplest way to do this obviously being teaching our parents). Lastly (although Hiltner does offer more avenues to fight climate change), Hiltner says that we must “fundamentally reinvent Western culture”, and therefore consumer culture. This is a massive undertaking but it must be done.


<br><hr>
I don't blame you for being disappointed or turned-off by ambiguous, uplifting calls to action. I think that it has become an overused strategy of mainstream climate activist movements, which is problematic. I've heard so many examples of people feeling compelled by videos like this, and then getting frustrated because they don't know what to do about it. Plenty of environmentalists are very good at pointing out the problems, but not so good at providing the solutions. The difficulty of providing solutions lies in the fact that the solution requires us to change EVERYTHING - this is a systemic issue. Simply put, we have to completely overturn our economic system and our model of development as a society and replace it with one that is not only sustainable, but equitable too. As you can imagine, this is a massive endeavor, and not something any individual can accomplish. However, as you stated, there are some concrete examples of small-scale change that you can do as an individual. As an individual, the most power you have to enact change is with your money (consumer choices, fundraising, donations) and your voice (voting, campaigning, protesting, conversation). Giving up eating meat, even if it's only beef and lamb, and even if it's only reducing your consumption by a fraction, is a very effective way to take action as an individual. Not buying clothes from massive corporations with unsustainable production chains that utilize slave labor conditions is another huge step you can take. Having open conversations with family, friends, peers, and strangers about the climate crisis and why we should all care is another very effective way to enact change.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. I was expecting Professor Hiltner to provide a long list of radical things we could change to help solve the climate crisis. However, his response is what most of us have heard before: to vote. Although, it gives me hope that our generation and future generations understand that climate change is a pressing issue that we have to face today. It is also disheartening to hear that two out of three people over the age of 65 voted. As a group, their voting powers is thus twice as great as the youngest generation of voters because they are voting twice as much. Therefore, the collective that denies climate change is occurring and the main culprits in climate change have more leverage in politics than we do. So, the solution to vote is also diluted by this statistic. I think it is important to note that this generational denial is discussed in Scott Wilson’s article, “2 Degrees Beyond the Limit”, as Wilson quotes Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams, “people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote.” This ties into Professor Hiltner’s lecture about why the generation that caused the climate change is not acting, due to the fact they never firsthand experienced significant negative consequences to the lifestyle they were living. I found it extremely interesting that Professor Hiltner touches on intergenerational learning, a term I have yet to hear, and it makes complete sense. However, for some family communication can be seen as very difficult, which could negatively impact this solution.

These two lectures significantly structure Ken’s central idea of the undergoing climate crisis. The first video, “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting”, explains the facts and situation extensively and theoretically. I learned that the unusual time delay is partially responsible, which results in non-action of current power-holders.      The more worrisome truth is that people in power now are those who primarily caused the climate change, including controllers of political and economical areas. At the same time, older citizens find the climate crisis less urgent. These elements elucidate how and why climate crisis happens and enhances consistently. 
<br><br>
The second video, “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis”, provides the practical and radical solution. I definitely agree with the importance of the reinvention of Western culture, such as consumerism and materialism. The reason is that many of my friends and families are significantly influenced by the opinion that buying stuffs could bring happiness. Many of these things are not necessary while damaging for the environment, such as cars and luxuries. However, as an international student, I are not able to vote in U.S., so as many other international people. Maybe the approach for our generation to take control of the planet through voting is feasible in U.S., but it’s harder for Gen Z from many other countries because of the lack of voting system. Moreover, I am not sure whether rebellion and activism are doable in many countries, especially the developing countries with central authority. I definitely hope that the control of our planet could be transferred to people who lay stress on the climate crisis.

After this video, I was pretty motivated to do some research and vote. I'm 18, so this will be my first opportunity to vote and this video made me realize the impact my vote could have on the world. However, I never thought about how discouraging this would be to watch from the point of view of an international student who is unable to vote in the United States, like you mentioned. 
<br><br>

This is where I see the importance of the transformation of consumerism and materialistic cultures. I understand that voting will have an impact but that it won't be enough or possible for everyone. The issue I see with changing western culture is the how. How are you going to get people to give up their car? How are do you get people to stop wanting things? I recognize the issue and see that the alteration of our culture is a possible solution, it's just hard to envision a world in which people give up such a huge part of our culture. One way I do see such a change in culture is if we are forced to change. Whether being forced by economic reasons or governmental regulations or for any other reason, only then will the population and a whole change. What I see as another way to change of culture is very slowly. Changing little by little will ease people into it. The problem with this approach is how much time is left. How long do we have to change our culture?

After watching, “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” I did feel more pressure to help “fix” our planet than ever before. However,  I am glad to be part of the generation that understands how vital it is to protect the environment and how we need to take action now. Something interesting about this lecture video is the ‘child to parent intergenerational learning’ topic. Growing up I remember telling my parents the importance of picking up our trash, how we’re supposed to be more environmentally friendly, and how we need to take care of the planet before it’s too late. At the moment I didn’t realize that I was already trying to put my part in raising awareness for climate change, I’m happy I did because even though it’s not a big change, I can see my parents being more cautious towards our environment. As part of the younger generation, I believe that we do have the power to keep voicing our concerns loudly to the older generation in control in order to spread awareness about the environment. An action this younger generation can take in the future is teaching our children at a young age how to reduce their carbon footprint. As Ken mentioned in his previous videos, we grew up with the addiction of fossil fuel, however I know if we don’t repeat that same mistake, we can have a future where fossil fuels are not used or closed to not being used anymore.

Since I was younger, I've also been continually trying to remind my parents to be environmentally friendly, whether it's by picking up our trash or not wasting food. However, it is hard to change old habits, but I still try my best to make my parents aware of their influence on the environment. I agree with you on how the younger generation does have power to voice our concerns to the older generation, rather than just following in their path and making the same mistakes. As Ken said in the video, it is important that we vote because that will really make the biggest difference. I never really thought that my vote would matter, but I do believe that, as a whole, our generation has a lot of power that we don't adequately take advantage of all the time. Furthermore, if we teach our children how to reduce their carbon footprint and act more environmentally friendly, then we do have a bright future. I am certain that we can make these changes in our own lifestyles before it is too late.

Ken’s speech really reminds me of the urgency to solve the problem of climate change. I know that the generations before us cause global warming. But we cannot simply blame them for everything. It is the duty of human to protect our the earth, the place we depend on to survive. It is time for our generation to take actions. We cannot just wait and delay the time. Rather, we meed to take actions immediately since global warming has already come to us. The consequence would be more severe if we do nothing. At the same time, we must realize that our mission is important. We need to raise the awareness of other people on this issue and solve the problem step by step. Although the task is difficult to fulfill, I believe we are able to make it through.

I appreciate your optimism and agree. It is an overwhelmingly daunting mission that we have no choice but to take on as we see the world around us falling down in one catastrophe after another. Yet, I think it is important to approach the issue with some hope and optimism, even just a glimmer. We can hold older generations responsible, but we should not be resentful to the older generations. They caused this problem, but it's done. All we can do is assess the situation, live each day actively working to fix it, and do everything else in our power to counteract the damage that has been done. I also agree that we must raise awareness about the issue. Many of us were raised by the people who helped contribute to the problem and though it is very difficult, we must make an effort to change our mindset and prepare for a new world, as we cannot continue living the way we do now.

For a long time, i know no country is really working under force to reduce the carbon dioxide they produce after signing the Paris Agreement, but the thing i rarely know about is that instead decreasing the rate of CO2 emission, our emission rate now is more than 5 times compared when the agreement was signed. The number is staggering, and make us wonder, why people take no action even knowing the severe consequences climate change might bring about. I don't think we can completely save the world from all the wildfires, the hole in O3 layer, all we can do and have to do today is do our best to delay the rate our dearest planet perishing away. It is all on us younger generation now.

I agree with Ken's statement that the way to effectively approach the climate situation is through politics-from local governments to federal. Because of the age averages of people in politics explaining inaction, more young people need to become much more politically active. It is situations like these where individuals do not need to become politic junkies, but use their political freedom to vote for politicians and policies that would benefit the climate. 
<br><br>

I also believe that as important as politics are in the roles that they could play in the climate crisis, the help we need from them will never come soon enough. This is why the state of the environment is in the hands of young people- us. We need to reiterate the fact that our actions play a major role in what is to become of the planet in the near future. We need to say it over and over again and develop ways that will make people truly aware how important their decisions are instead of just letting the facts pass them by. How can young generations be so influential that they change the minds of the generations before them? I'm afraid it's not going to happen.

I believe that the next generation of politician will be the ones who will make the greatest fight against the climate crisis. The old generation has no passed on yet and the younger generation, our generation, will be stressed with a dying world that is being smashed substantial amounts of pollution. Politics and good politicians are willing to combat this issue will determine the fate of our species. Those that have access to a nations resources will be the biggest players in this fight for survival. Not only one nation but all nations including our enemies. In order to save our species we must put aside our differences with other nations and work together to reduce pollution that will affect all of us. Obviously easier said then done, however this next generation, our generation, will decide the fate of our species.


<br><hr>
I agree with what you are saying that we need to act now. That we need to do this by not only voting ourselves but influencing people around us to vote. Even though our generation of votes may not become the largest group of voters, as Ken said we could definitely make an impact. I think by making it known that people will continue to suffer more and more if we do not take action people will begin to use their voices. 
<br><br>
But something that I think could make a huge difference aside from voting is through our daily voices. As Ken mentioned in lecture, 5 of the 7 richest companies are those who deal with fossil fuels. With their immense wealth comes power that is controlling politics. They are funding endless politicians making it impossible to see change in laws and taxes that will make America become more sustainable. I think the best way to make a change with these companies is to reduce our use of them. The more our young generation of society begins to shift away from unsustainable consumption the less money these companies will have. Thus with less money, their power will diminish.

I think one of the biggest reasons why older generations do not believe in climate change is because usually, you can't physically see the damages done to our planet. I remember seeing a clip of Donald Trump saying that climate change is "fake news" because it felt colder than usual on that particular day. The older generation fails to realize that climate and weather are two different things--climate is the long term effect on our planet, and weather pertains to short-term day-to-day patterns of temperature or rain. Just because you can't see or feel it at this exact moment doesn't mean it's not happening. A good parallel is the earth's rotation. As we stand on the ground, we cannot feel it move or tilt in any way, but it is, in fact, spinning on its axis. Yet, we accept this fact, but not the big picture of climate change. 
<br><br>


The words "You need to take control of this planet" deeply resonates within me because I feel almost as if Ken is directly talking to me. I'd like to call myself eco-friendly: I bike to school, use reusable water bottles, reusable straws, etc. However, I am not a vegan/vegetarian. I still continue to eat meat, even though the beef industry is the biggest contributor to America's CO2 levels. I would always tell myself that the little things I do, such as conserving energy at my apartment in IV or thrift shopping will make up for the fact that I still order a double-double at In n Out. But, I now realize that I need to act now. My selfish meat choices are harming our environment, and I need to utilize my knowledge from Climate Crisis to make a change with as much impact as possible. I cannot wait for others to act--I must take a stand and suggest others to do the same. I know that immediately cutting out all meat is unreasonable and the plan will soon crash and burn, so I'm committing myself to vegetarianism three days a week. I hope that through this transition, one day I can be a full vegetarian, or even a vegan.

<br><br>

In addition to a diet change, I fully agree with Ken when he advises everyone to vote. In America, it seems kind of fruitless to vote because there's an electoral college that will actually vote on the candidates. But, with every vote we can continue to show the electoral college what the citizens actually want. Yes, we have a flawed system of voting, but we have got to work with what we've got. I think that a lot of people opt out of voting because they think that their vote doesn't matter, but it does. For instance, if you look at Florida which pretty much decided whether Trump or Clinton would become our president, the votes were incredibly close. If those who chose not to vote because they thought their vote didn't matter actually had voted in 2016, perhaps Trump would not be our president and we would not have withdrawn from the Paris agreement. Alas, it is too late to ponder "what if's," so we must focus on the future and make sure that this mistake never happens to our country again.

After watching the video, I realized that what our generation has done is very important. We should start to learn to make some practical actions and then pass them on to the next generation. So as to change the view of the next generation of the climate crisis. Although the older generation did not take any practical actions to protect the environment, they spread a lot of lies about climate change because of the false news in the media. But we can't just blame the older generation, because this idea is passed down from generation to generation. So we need to make changes, and we have a responsibility to protect the environment and mitigate the threat of climate change. It's also up to the next generation to know the severity of the climate crisis and get them in the right way.

After watching the lecture video, I strongly agree with Ben Wang’s opinion. Just as the professor mentions in the video, most politicians are around 60s. It is too late for us to realize the importance of protecting the planet until we are 60s. Now, we meet a good chance that has many people reminds us and advises us to control our planet. We have to give some practical actions. For example, in the video, the professor said that global CO2 emission has increased 2.7 percent. One personal practical action is we can decrease our personal carbon footprint in order to reduce the personal CO2 emission, such as eating less beef, taking public transportation. Sometimes, we do not correctly recognize the harmful consequence of climate change because we do not feel their change physically until it has already formed the serious injury such as cliffs erosion, forest fire, flood and so on. We cannot omit the small change in temperature and need to take action to control our planet right now.


<br><hr>
I fully agree with you that our generation has done much better than the previous generations to bring awareness to the public about the severity of the situation. And yes, I also strongly believe that the next step in our climate change education should be based around solutions to the problem. While Ken's generation did essentially jumpstart the climate catastrophe, we are continuing the enable their unsustainable practices. Therefore, while still raising awareness and demanding change on a global level, we should also work on demonstrating eco-friendly alternatives to society and to the future generations. Yes, we should be upset about the dire consequences that we have been left to deal with. But, resent and pessimism won't help solve this global crisis. The fact that global CO2 emissions are now rising faster than they ever have, is utterly appalling. This statistic underscores how much more there is to be done by the youth. It is now our responsibility to convey to the older and younger generations what is happening, but more importantly, what can be done.

After watching the lecture, ‘why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting’ and ‘what a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis’, it was sad to know the old generation which caused some of the factors of climate change did not want to take the action to change the environment. As we talked about in the lecture, the politicians has already figured out the climate change but they did not take action to solve this problem effectively. What they do is chosen to let this happen or let the younger generation to deal with it. But in fact, it’s too late. The best time for people to take action to save the earth is in 1960 when the politicians first find out the climate change. If they started to do something at that time, the climate change would not be so serious right now. The wildfire, the floods, the air pollution, the hunger and many people live with so less water, all of these are the consequences of climate change. But we know it’s hard to twist the old generation’s mind because they live in a perfect environment for almost their whole life. And from now, it’s our generation living now, we face the problem they did not faced. Consequently, they can not feel what is really happen right now. All of the government are those old generation, same, we can not rely on them to save the world, to change the living environment. What we can do is as professor Hiltner said, the young generation have to act right now. Then we have the chance to save it. We can only rely on our generation to take the place in the government to make plan to save the world.

I really like how you pointed out how most politicians are of those in the baby boomer era. Like Ken said in "what a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis," we must take control because right now the people in control are those who choose to ignore the signs and consequences of climate change. Ken mentions in, "why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting," that the older generation isn't doing much simply because they're in denial and don't want to be blamed for potentially the end of the world. For example, Donald Trump, Mike Pence along with others are in denial of climate change. These are the people making our laws, influencing the people of our country. I do agree with Ken that we need to vote and vote for those who advocate for saving our planet. It's hard because our government is so corrupt with money and power, people would rather take that instead of trying to stop/reduce climate change. It's sad that they let greed take over. Our generation is the ones who understand the weight of the situation and are trying to help, but it's annoying how we have to fix it when the ones who broke it stay in the corner gambling power.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with this comment and I think the point you made about how it's hard to convince the older generation of this climate problem simply because they lived in a near perfect environment their whole life is very true. I don't think that we will get anywhere with climate change if the politics around it aren't altered because coincidentally the easiest way to take control of the planet is to be a political figure in charge of it. This could be a good thing if there were more young, bright minded people leading efforts to make a change and introducing new ideas but our congress is just simply old. Sadly, the people voting them back into their positions is the old generation that doesn't believe the climate crisis is a problem in the first place. If thinking of themselves, they are right, they will never have to deal with climate problems like our generation will and so of course they will choose other issues to prioritize. We as a younger generation, need to find a way to not only voice our opinions, but actually be given the platform to make a change.

Professor Hiltner's statement that it is up to this generation to pull us out of the climate crisis is frightening, yet doable. The solutions that we have to jumpstart are as simple as voting and communicating the problems. While it is hard to practice what we preach, I think that it's much easier in this day and age because people are already aware and may be practicing sustainability already. When I was in high school, I went vegan and, although it was very exciting and made me feel productive, others made comments and put me down. After some time, people became curious and asked me why I chose that lifestyle. My own practice, although it was difficult, helped educate those around me and even encouraged them to try it. I remember that my mother was skeptical and was worried that I would be malnourished. After she did her own research, she began trying plant-based foods and incorporating them into her diet. Since then, she's kept an open mind, and now my siblings are mostly plant-based.
<br><br>
My point is that practices evoke interest and conversation. Southern California, I've noticed, is well aware of environmentally friendly actions and practices that have become more accessible over the years. With social media we have power to be heard, proving to be another advantage that we can use. I think that starting small, initiating conversations about the issue, voting, and keeping a larger goal in mind is an easy start to tackling climate change.

I definitely agree with your idea that many people now realize the importance of sustainability and start to practice. More and more people in the world start to try to use sustainable resource instead of fossil fuel. I think this is definitely a good phenomenon, but it is still not enough. Although more and more people started to realize the climate crisis, it is still not a global knowledge for all the people, and the number of people who really take action to actually do something is certainly not big enough to let the those people of Professor Ken’s generation, who are still in power realize seriousness of the situation and also take part in to help change the situation and correct the mistakes they make when they were young. Therefore, I think all those small actions are good, and there should be more of them to make a big difference and prevent the future uninhabitable earth.

When watching this lecture one thing that stood out to me was when Ken mentioned that an effective way in which we start rebelling against the climate crisis is for parents to start transferring knowledge onto their children, which they will then pass on to their children and future generations, in hopes of influencing the world tremendously. This action of transferred knowledge from one generation to the next is like Ken mentioned, what we need to fundamentally reinvent Western culture. I believe this is a great way of starting to act against the issue. I feel like today the number of parents and families in general who are implementing changes in their lifestyles and teaching the ways of their household to help the planet is very small and surely not enough. Being in this class for only almost two weeks has already made me open my eyes so much to the reality of the current tragedies our earth is going through. This lecture, in particular, convinced me how important it is for my generation to be aware of these issues and to spread our knowledge out to people we know because we are the upcoming ones that can create and initiate change. There are so many things we can change in our day to day activities that do not even dramatically change what we are used to. Simple actions such as making sure you turn off the lights and unplug devices before you leave your house is a great way in becoming energy-efficient, helping cut down on energy use in your household. As mentioned in this article, I agree that voting is also an easy and effective way to improve climate change. We need to help in voting for the right people in legislation and the politicians that will aid against the harmful effects of climate change. We need to make the climate crisis more known to everyone, so that action to help save the planet will become an admired thing to do.

I think we as the "children" have to also educate our parents in turn! I found Ken's point about the voting power discrepancy between young and old very interesting and illuminating. Although I am not American I recognise the role America and American youth have in choosing the right leaders for the free world, and would urge them to go out there and do it. While they are at it, they should also educate and convince my their parents and grandparents!
<br><br>

In Cyprus my grandparents voted against their personal preferences because of me telling them about my younger perspective of the candidates. We as young people have power over our parents, loved ones and friends and should leverage that power. Voting is the definitely a very efficient, easy, and effective way to help in the battle of the climate crisis.
<br><br>

Soon enough though, I think all politicians will realise that it will not be sustainable for them to move against the climate change movement in any capacity, as the problems become more obvious. Still, the transition to "sustainably minded" politicians should happen as quickly as possible.
<br><hr>
I also agree with the point that parent to children conversations are the best ways to communicate climate change issues because those conversations will come from a familiar source that will provide more weight to the topic for the older generation to understand. And you make a good point that our generation does, in fact, have the knowledge to educate others and we should use this knowledge to our advantage. 
<br><br>


Greta Thunberg’s journey with environmental activism is a prime example that, yes, it is possible for the younger generation to take control on the issue of climate change. She is living proof that our generation can have a significant voice in the matter. As a seventeen year old she has caught national attention for her school strike, her UN climate action summit speech, and much more. The issue is that although we can get attention for taking action and have a significant voice, it will be a lot of work tearing down the big industries that are causing the most damage. Actually undoing what the last generation caused will be a much more difficult issue and I’m afraid it will take too long to achieve. The best thing to do is find the right political candidates that hopefully promise to carbon tax these companies and significantly put their foot down on consumption abuse in the US in order to enact valuable change.

<br><hr>

I think you summed it up well. Similarly, I am on board for the transfer of knowledge. Currently I am taking a class on women, globalization, and justice where a focus is the environment in third world countries as a result of a handful of countries that are the major contributors of greenhouse gasses and capitalism. Take the Green Revolution in India as an example. The purpose was to modernize agriculture and water systems to benefit those who started the so called progressive movement. As a result, women lost all respect in their jobs, they couldn’t feed themselves or their families as they transitioned from personal crop to cash crops, the environment worsened, and the men started committing suicide. This was all because big business oil companies behind the Green Revolution thought that taking a human right such as water away was ok to turn it into a commodity. 

<br><br>

Two weeks into this lecture, I have shared the documentaries we were required to watch because they were so moving. In addition, I have shared articles, videos, and even spewed out some facts in some conversations. I have made sure my friends and family are registered to vote, started being more consumer conscious, and have even started walking more than driving.

The first lecture specifically lists several groups that revolt against climate crisis. From what he says, groups of people that protests for protecting the environment are all belong to the new generation. The old generation, however, exists a lot of deniers. The data in this lecture shows that 30 percent of people believe that climate change are not a result of human activities. This statistic points out that there are still a lot of people who do not really care about the climate change. They do not put the climate in priority and refuse to do anything helpful to the environment.
 <br><br>

On the contrary, this video gives us a exciting news that the new generation are enthusiastic towards protecting the earth. Nevertheless, the impact of revolting against climate crisis is not strong enough because most people who hold the power are belong to the old generation. This situation will be altered in twenty years once the old generations resigns, and soon afterwards the new generation takes their positions.

I definitely agree without that there are a lot of deniers in the old generation and our generation is definitely more verbal when it comes to climate change, but I think the reason that we go out of our ways to protest is because the consequences of the people before us will fall upon us, and we will have to deal with heat death and ocean acidification. Typical of human nature, the majority of the Baby Boomers do not recognize the urgency of Climate Change because chances are, they will be gone before the real catastrophy begin. Compared to Social Securities and Healthcare, which are more important to the people at that age, the climate doesn't matter, and unlucky for us, the majority of our government is made out of the people of that age. So we might be loud, but if we can't change their mind, we will get nothing done. Yet if we wait until we are at their age and be in positions of power, it would be already too late. 1.8 degree Celcius has increased, and if Old men of Congress keep delaying the inevitable, our generation and the future generation may not have a habitable home. We can't wait to change, we must change now because it is already too late.

"You need to take control of this planet" powerful words spoken from a place of idealism. The need for change is imminent, and I don't think we have the political clout and knowledge to correctly achieve the legislative victories we need right now to begin the path to recovery. 

<br><br>
In a rapidly changing world, we should have versatile and effective leaders and Professor Hiltner is correct in that our generation is in some ways best equipped to fill that role as the disconnect but reality and feelings aren't as pronounced in our generation. What we lack in experience we make up for in our ability to see through facades put forward by hack scientists and their corporate overlords. Despite this our generation (gen Z or Zoomers as we prefer to be called) is ready to vote and support those who promise us the change we desire, but I do not foresee our generation taking control. 
<br><br>


Greta Thunberg is correct in that too much is expected of us. We are expected to surrender the ill-gotten gains of western nations, our homes, and act against what seems like our self-interest in order to save our planet. I only hope that we can save the planet, if not for us then for the innocents harmed by the hubris of previous generations.

It is scary how much rests on our hands, the planet’s future really depends on whether or not we can somehow change western culture and actually become the new leaders of this world. But it is much easier said than done. Although my generation is full of activism and young bright minds that are aware of the problems, there are also groups who have become deeply pessimistic. Some people in my generation fear that their votes won’t make a difference or that no significant change can come; it is already too late to save our planet. We see how much power the older generation has and believe that we cannot change their minds or push them to make policies that will actually help the world. It is so easy to sit back and do nothing, “why even bother? We’re already doomed.” Being the hero is no easy feat, but if we stay frozen in fear then we will become just as bad as the perpetrators of all this suffering and pollution. I think that we need to teach our generation how to effectively communicate the climate crisis to not only each other but the other generations. From there, we must show others how to actually make differences from what we eat to how we participate in activism. Just by voting, we can have better policies and politicians who are actually willing to make real change. I think that a lot of people are scared about the climate crisis, but they don’t know how to actually help so education will be key to this movement’s success.


<br><hr>
While I agree that we absolutely have to do something about climate change in the western world, I also think it is important to note that many people are still resistant to change, and that it will take all of youth to get behind this movement.
<br><br>
 I do not see a wide spread revolution taking place that would be impactful enough within generation Z’s next few years that will allow us to make up for all the lost time. I believe that we need to pressure current polititians into making drastic changes regarding our climate policies. Ultimately polititians work for their constituents, so if they fear not being re-elected, they will pay attention. The main focus should be to put climate change into the public eye and keep it there. This will take time and hopefully once Gen Z is in office there will be a congress more compelled to listen to science. 
 <br><br>
Once in office, Gen Z needs to push for tech that will not only curve the the global emissions downwards, but also invest in tech that can extract greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere. It is then, that the USA and other global superpowers can start helping other nations effectively.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. So much pressure is put on our generation to turn things around and yes we need to find some way to gain power and make a change. But there is one substantial obstacle standing in our way. Everyone in our country that is misleading about the severity of the climate crisis. I think what is necessary to tackle first is helping those who are misled and uninformed so that they are aware of the dangers that face future generations. Our generation is not able to fully take political control of this issue, we need those in power to help and they are the ones holding us back from making any real change.

 <br><br>

I think the problem is that most of the leaders of the whole that believe that this climate crisis is not something that they have any power over is completely wrong. While it's important that the young adults of this current generation continue to make proactive steps towards a changing out planet it's impossible to do that through political actions that can actually pull significant weight in this issue.  Most of the baby-boomers aren't even trying to educate themselves on what's happening because it's not gonna affect them when 2/3 of older people vote, they have a large voice in political and could help change the climate.
 <br><br>


Overall, while I do agree that we have to take steps towards a better environment, we are not the only ones that need to participate and help the planet.
<br><hr>

Before hearing the professor’s sentence “you need to take control of this planet”, I didn’t realize the severity and urgency of addressing the climate crisis, and right now, I feel like suddenly there is a huge pressure on my shoulders. However, after thinking clearly about these climate issues, I believe that our generation ought to take responsibility and begin to deal with the climate changes due to the two reasons following. 
 <br><br>
First, we as the children should help the old generations in our family who didn’t believe climate crisis to realize that they are all happening extremely urgent. Because of the time delay for the consequences of the climate crisis, many people in the old-generation who may be contributors of greenhouse gases didn’t see the negative effects their actions brought to the environment, thus see the climate crisis as an issue with low importance, and paying little time to deal with it. However, the consequences of the climate crisis are now appearing. By using the method of “child-to-parent intergenerational learning”, the young generations are able to convert their attitudes as well as ideas to the old generations, thus let them realize the importance of protecting the natural environment. 
 <br><br>
Secondly, as the professor mentions it is us, the young generations as well as our children, who have to live with all negative effects on Earth which human-caused pollutions brought. In order to help ourselves to live in better lives, we need to begin to “take control of this planet,” and think of ways to deal with the severe climate changes. Climate crisis are urgent, people don’t have any extra time to waste, we need to take actions to protect the environment IMMEDIATELY.
<br><hr>
I loved Ken saying that we need to take control of our planet without violence! I agree with you that we do not have political clout, however I do think that there are people who have some knowledge to achieve the legislative victories we need to begin the path to recovery! Ken brought up Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who was in her 20s when she was elected the youngest woman in Congress and introduced the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is a path to recovery, we just need the political power to do so! 
 <br><br>

I think that if we can vote correctly than our generation can take control. Yes, i agree with Greta Thunberg that too much is expected of us. It can’t just be us making these changes while everyone else can continue on with their unsustainable lives. If we want sh*t to get done to save our planet then everyone has to be in this or we all go down together. Like Ken said, we’re going to have to fundamentally reinvent western culture, especially consumer culture and the belief that our happiness lies in what we have. This is so unhealthy for everyone and their mental health! We must turn back to putting our values in each other and our community rather than the car or phone we have. We do in a sense have to go against our own self-interest and what we have been taught our whole lives, but that’s what you’re supposed to do. You must change your beliefs when you are given new information otherwise how are we to grow? To adapt? To survive?
<br><hr>

I understand where Ken is coming from, however I have an issue with “you need to take control of this planet” because really, what are we supposed to do? Individually, one can take many steps to minimize their carbon footprint, but what about the oil industries? What about those who can not just encourage change but demand it through legislation? We might be in the position to inherit the earth in 30 years when everyone in power now has been recycled and a new body of legislators has taken it upon themselves to try and change laws that do more harm than good, but that’ll be too late. Everyone keeps emphasizing the fact that there is a very small window of time to prevent an uncontrolled warming of the planet, and we are in it. So how can we really be expected to take it upon ourselves? We can demand change as much as we want, but in the end climate change has become a political issue with a very clear divide. And on top of that, the mobilization that needs to occur--which will surpass geographical, political, and economic boundaries--seems unlikely unless something truly horrible happens that forces everyone to act. What will it take?

One of the biggest ways to solve the climate crisis is to vote. 
 <br><br>


Professor Hiltner hinted at this when he said to take 5 of your friends out to vote. If every one of us did that, we would have an overwhelming number of people who support the cause to fight climate change. Activism starts with the individual. We are the foundation of the future. 
 <br><br>


Despite saying all this, I do not believe that our generation will be taking control in government any time soon. The fact that there are still 80-year olds still running for their seats speaks volumes about how slow to change our government is. Developments with AOC and the new freshman class of democrats in congress are comforting, but it is going to take way longer for a cultural shift to change.

Lecture Comment: The part of this lecture that stuck out the most to me was how the older generations ranked the importance of climate change to them. The fact that it was towards the lower end of ranking for the three generations with the most political power was sickening. The fact that it's not the most concerned issue makes me take offense. By the older generations delaying taking action on climate and putting it on the to-do list, they selfishly are living worry-free of what's to come and locking my kids generation and their kids generation to a scared and damaged Earth. In the 1960's politicians were made aware of climate change and the possible effects but they chose to not act on it since there were no evident effects of climate change occurring. This was a costly mistake since we could've made leaps and bounds towards solving the climate crisis had we started in the 60's but since we didn't, we've now reached this point. Rather than the future generations repeating this same narrative about how the people in charge of our time failed to look past agendas and money, they could talk about how we finally were people to find a solution to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
Sadly with older generations having lived there entire life without the consequences of climate change, it makes it difficult to communicate how large of an issue it actually is. These same people also have a majority of the political power so the amount of action being taken is limited. This is why I 100% agree with Professor Hiltner the current generation needs to take control of politics because the older generations have shown they aren't willing to make the necessary changes. So rather than wait like the generations before us we need to act now.

 your comment is exactly correct. I think I know what the issue is. It is really hard to get people to pay attention to a problem that is not looking them right in the eyes. It’s a problem of the future but it is not a problem now. The problems right now are gun control and abortion and our president. That is what the professor’s generation is trying to fix because those are the problems of right now. For us to say, “wait, what about my children and my grand children’s generations,” seems unreasonable at this time. I know it is what needs to happen but unfortunately America is dealing with way too many pressing issues at the moment. 
<br><br>
When Professor Hiltner said that what we need to do is vote and tell our friends to vote, I listened. I would normally agree with that but at the end of the day we live in California. Our votes do not matter. What matters most is not who we vote for president, but more so who we put in congress. And in that case, our votes do matter. Congress has the ability to change the climate. 
<br><br>

I liked the part in his lecture about our generation needing to tell our parents and teach them what is going to happen to our world once they’re dead. I love telling my mom and dad that they are wrong, so this is right up my alley :)


<br><hr>
The older generations ranking of climate change was one of the main things that shocked me the most in this lecture video as well. Issues like terrorism, immigration reform, and border security were all ranked above the issue of global warming. Global warming should definitely be the top ranked issues for older generations considering they were the ones who caused the most damage. It is a simple fact that the older you are, the less urgent you find the climate crisis. They have the power politically to try and make a change, but instead they are ignoring the issues and causing future generations to suffer. These people are in a state of deep denial and typically want to lash out at messengers. They try to believe that scientists are wrong and want to believe that these issues are caused by natural weather patterns that have always been happening. It is honestly no surprise to me that these older generations are in a deep denial because they don’t want to admit how much damage they caused for future generations. We need to shift the power to a generation who actually cares about the issues of climate change if we want to see an immediate change. Our generation also needs to vote so we can overpower the older generations votes. We have seen an increase in 18-29 year old voters which is great, but we are nowhere near outvoting older people. I believe it is also vital for kids to teach their parents about the issues of the climate crisis too. If we are able to tell them how important this is for our generation and our children's generations, they could be more intrigued to help make a change. Older generations choose to ignore the issues at hand so they aren’t aware of the severity of the issues. This needs to change! Once they start becoming aware of these issues we could easily start making a change NOW.

What will one vote do? This is a question that plagues the youth of America because in some cases they really believe that the power of this country is too highly concentrated to be shifted. What they don’t realize is the only reason people in Ken’s generation have the power is because they exercise their right to vote. Politicians want our votes. In a way these politicians are the people’s puppets because they will cater to whatever the popular opinion of the people is. This is why the best way for us to mitigate climate change is to care about the environment and cast our vote accordingly. We will truly get chain when policy is changed in favor of reducing carbon emissions. A climate tax would poll poorly unless people like us vote in favor of it. How great would it be to be remembered as the generation that brought about great change? Although young adults in the 60’s and 70’s were labeled as rebellious, they created political pressure that resulted in change as Ken stated in the video. The roaring 20’s are upon us so let’s make our voices heard. Communication is the key to impacting votes because if we communicate the severity of this issue to our elders and those around us, we can educate others and that is when they will start to care. It comes down to the habits of Americans but we can change the habits of many with the changes that could be brought about by voting. There are about 7 miles of bike paths on UCSB’s campus and because these paths are available they are widely used by our campus’s population. Imagine if whole cities had bike paths to encourage carbon free transportation. The city council would be hard pressed to garner funding for bike paths city wide if no one would vote in favor. However, if it became popular culture to bike then these paths would be in place almost everywhere. If a carbon tax were to be put in place it would be popular for companies to aim at reducing their emissions. If it became popular to wear thrifted clothing then a renewable fashion would take over. Let’s make saving the planet popular.

I agree with your mindset that changing how people vote and creating popularity for climate change is one of the key ways in which we can cause meaningful change. Developing strong policy for climate action and garnering support from a diverse set of generations is inherently difficult, but it must be done. In addition, I think that being remembered as a generation that worked on mitigating this crisis is very important, as we should not just be another generation who took a less aggressive approach.


<br><hr>
Many people, young people in particular argue that their vote doesn’t matter, that their voice is so small in this country that it won’t have any impact on the outcome of our presidential election. This questions indeed plagues the youth, but thankfully I also believe the majority of my generation is waking up and realizing the cruciality of voting. As Ken mentioned, much of the older generations in America continue to be in a state of denial, and they tend to question the truth. Perhaps they don’t want to take the blame for the climate crisis, or perhaps they  support the money hungry fossil fuels industry. Although older generations govern our country, there are politicians who support climate change initiatives, such as the green new deal, and it is crucial that my generation votes for them. Time is no longer on our side, and we need to take control of our planet, and save it from further dismay. 
<br><br>

This issue is the defining problem of our time, and as Ken has mentioned before we can either be known as the heroes, or the ultimate villains. I must admit I have not done too much research on the presidential candidates, but I do know who I’m leaning towards and why supporting the green new deal is crucial. Right after this video I texted a few friends asking them if they are registered to vote, which everyone should do.

<br><hr>

While skimming through the comments of this video, I found that there is still a significant amount of my classmates that were angered by the fact that Ken directs the responsibility to take action against climate change at our generation. Although I share that frustration, I feel that it is unfair to respond to this with a stubborn “it-shouldn’t-be-my-problem” attitude. It is arguable that if we went back in time, we would make the same mistakes by pushing off climate change until we reach this same point, where we must realize that, ultimately, it is not important who caused it, but rather what steps we need to take.

<br><br>

I really appreciated the fact that Ken does not only tell us that we need to “take control of this planet,” but provides us with ways to do so. I feel that with concrete steps, more people would be inclined to join the fight against climate change. As expressed in your comment, I agree that voting (and encouraging others to do so too!) for the right people and the right policies is the first big step in ensuring that we aim our focus in the right direction. At the moment, the numbers may stand against our favor with two-thirds of baby boomers dominating the polls. Fortunately, however, the younger generations seem to be grasping the weight of their votes and, as a result, their percentage in the polls are climbing. This provides a positive outlook on the political aspect of climate change. My only concern is that the percentage needs to grow a lot more quickly if we hope to save our planet on time. 

<br><br>

I also admire your idea of making changes to our lifestyles - from bike paths to thrifting to carbon taxes to vegan diets - that would help combat climate change popular. After all, gaining popularity is an obsession much of our generation is guilty of. I only hope that more people join the fight and realize that climate change is not one of those problems that we can take a rain check on.

After watching this video I was a little angered realizing how crucial it is for my generation to understand this information and how little are actually receiving it. It is up to us to attempt to slow the inescapable crisis that the world will face due to human activity. Hearing those words is hard. For me it was like a slap on the face, the people generations before us knew what they were doing but continued to advance their technologies and became corrupt to the point of disaster. Convincing parents is extremely difficult for those who have family members who solely trust news and media and as of now...news and media are corrupt too. People need to start hearing the truth from this older generation, the one who makes the decisions and who talks on the media, but no. The media is corrupt and facilitates lies about the climate and the severity of the problem. Truth will only guide communication and lead to a change in society, maybe one that could bring change to the world. Things do get done with a large group of people and their opinion and that is what the world needs...number in changing the climate crisis.
<br><br>

Another part of this lecture that stood out to me was the way Ken described the climate crisis as in who caused it and who will suffer from it. Ken stated that while we all are suffering trying to find a semi-solution for this problem the generation who most caused it will be under the ground resting peacefully. I do not like putting blame solely onto one generation but I do think it is okay to say that the worst of our evils was the generation in which Ken grew up in as their influence was delayed...and then escalated the crisis at extreme, unexpected rates. That generation had an idea as to what they were doing but just like our generation only a few know the exact effects and it takes word of mouth/communication to bring awareness to issues. I believe that my generation from learn from the past and communicate on the real issues and explain how crucial issues really are. Sugarcoating issues has only worsened the problem.

I completely agree.
<br><br>

Starting with us, generations will be born into a world of the climate crisis.  Here they will know nothing more than the damage that has been done to the planet by the baby boomer generation and that they are left with the responsibility of cleaning up this mess.  In this sense, in causing the climate crisis to reach such severity, the lives of future generations were knowingly signed away to a life of hardship in tending to the mitigation of our planet.  From now on each generation will have to try its hand at preserving the world at the very least.
<br><br>

The issue of the climate crisis is here and here to stay, so what needs to happen is the media, and all modes of communication, to give the public the situation as it is, an urgent crisis.  There can be no more of biased media or covering up of what is truly going on.  Big money should not be a part of informing the public because for too long have fossil fuel interests spun the situation in their favor to allow their profits to continue rolling in.  The same goes for democracy.  It should not be connected to outside interests who control the important decisions that are made to decide how countries are run.  Now is the time for the climate crisis to be brought to the table to discuss in depth to develop a plan of mitigation.


<br><hr>
As the younger generation, I personally feel that it is easier for us to understand climate change rather than the older generation because they can’t admit that it was their fault for what is happened to the earth. They have never considered if their actions caused harm to the planet because they claimed they haven’t seen any repercussions occur so they don’t think it’s their fault. What they don’t understand is that their carefree spending and actions have their negative effects that take a toll on the younger generations and the generations that are yet to come. I think as the younger generation, we have to take a stand and educate the old and young ones about climate change in order to stand a chance for the future. 

<br><br>

Learning that officials in government are all almost in their 60s and they don’t understand climate change or claiming it’s false and that scientists are just trying to lie makes me so speechless because there are physical, negative environmental changes that are occurring. For example, the biggest wildfires that happened throughout history occurred within the past five years and I don’t think this is a coincidence. Also, the ices are also melting due to rising temperatures which causes sea levels to rise. I think Ken does a good job of explaining what the younger generation has to deal with the effects of climate change has to do such as think about the things we buy, eat, spend and use.

<br><hr>

 I too am left feeling frustrated and in some ways powerless. I recognize it is kind of ironic for a video intended to provide ways for our generation to take action to leave me feeling hopeless, but nonetheless that is in a way how I feel. I am beginning to feel that in our current political system it will be nigh impossible to enact change swiftly enough in order to make a difference. The voices that call for revolution are beginning to speak louder to me. This is a strange feeling given my prior feelings towards revolution and violence. I too do not condone the use of violence, however I must say that those that endorse that view are beginning to sound more logical. The American and French Revolutions both (especially the latter) brought about quick dramatic change due to violence. However, this contradicts my moral upbringing with the ideals of Gandhi and Martin Luther King. My grandparents were around in the time of Gandhi and imparted his ideals onto me. Gandhi as a philosopher had a deep love for the environment, I too as a student of his philosophy deeply care about the environment and the natural order. I have a deep passion for the natural order and life as a whole. I believe that our societal actions directly correlate to the ecology of our planet. The xenophobic desires of the new populist government are only going to exacerbate the pressures of climate change. As Ken says it is time to utilize our political efficacy and remove the current administration from office, and install a regime that understands the value of our environment. "The Revolution will not be televised."
<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. I feel like climate change is easy to talk about but actually when you finally face the danger, you would realize how much dangerous it could be and I think it’s far from our imagination. After reading Wallace-Wells’s article, I feel like I have deeper understanding about how’s climate change going on. And only the young generation can try to save it now.
<br><hr>
I agree with these thoughts too. I think it's frightening how the people who are politically in charge are the ones who created this crisis, and still do not see the urgency in fixing it. As children, I think we are taught to look up to our elders- however, in this case, I think it's time for our elders to come to us. This idea is explained by Professor Ken's theory on child to parent intergenerational learning. I know that so far after the few lectures I have attended in this class, I have already called my parents reiterating all my new knowledge on the climate crisis.
<br><br>

I think it's very important for my generation to grab the reigns and confront this issue head on. I have read other comments in which students explain how they reduce their driving or have become vegan. I think these are two very doable things that have significant impact. I think that although this generation can be quite materialistic and feeds off the consumer culture, I feel like this could be used to our benefit. If we start a movement, even on social media, people are bound to tag along and follow. It's important for my generation to spread awareness- reposting informative information and sharing with friends and family always helps. Overall, this crisis is terrifying but I do think our generation has it in us to start a powerful movement to help combat this issue.
<br><hr>
 I agree with everything you said Alyssa, it is incredibly frustrating that our generation is forced to deal with the mistakes of the generations before us. For me the most annoying part of this is not the fact we have to understand this information, it is the fact that it is clear climate change exists and it is a problem. We have known about this issue for generations, and they knew exactly what the problem was, it is not like all of the sudden we discovered climate change, we have known its danger, but older generations ignored it because they did not want to take one for the team and change their ways, instead they pushed it to the side, ignored the scary “what if’s” and raised each new generation to be dependent on the things that are killing our planet. It is truly upsetting knowing those who put us in this situation are dead and gone, they left the rest of us in a horrible situation and people around the world are now suffering because of them, and they aren’t even here to suffer with us. I also hate how no matter how many people believe in climate change that does not mean they will actually start making changes to their life, and those who do will be making a small impact. It is true that every little thing counts, but the real change starts once big corporations like Exxon, Shell, and BP start implementing changes. It is important for people to come together and start making changes in their lives, but until these companies start changing their ways we won’t be seeing any significant changes in our emissions.


<br><hr>

I couldn't agree more with the feeling of anger and frustration that comes from the realization that the predicament we face was allowed to happen by those that preceded us. It truly makes me doubt that people can be inherently good when so many people have sat by passively and watched those in control destroy the world around them. While I know that a much higher percentage of young adults believe in climate change, I fear that many are still influenced by ignorant parents. I realize that I have practically  identical views as my parents, it just so happens that they do believe and make an effort to fight against it. 
<br><br>

I think that Ken's proposal to the youth, and everyone really, to vote and to tell 5 others to vote is a strong step in the right direction. While almost everyone is exposed to both sides of the argument on climate change and in politics, the real difference would be an in person conversation with someone on the edge. The only way my generation will be able to make positive changes is in solidarity, and that all begins now by starting an open dialogue on the issue of politics at all levels to eventually remove the politicians in the pockets of the fossil fuel industry.

After watching this and the previous lecture, the issue of the climate crisis appears all the more frustrating. In addition to there being a variety of catastrophic weather events, exponential temperature rise and denial by the media, the generation most to blame for the climate crisis continues to face little to no consequence. For those above the age of 40, most of their life was spent with no apparent changes to the atmosphere or weather conditions. As such, they did little to make their behaviors more environmentally friendly and paid little mind to the damage that was starting to appear. Now, as generation x and the baby boomers reach middle and retirement age, devastating consequences of the climate crisis are abundant and terrifying. However, because these groups spent so much time feeling no consequence, they don't consider slowing climate change to be a priority. In those age groups, climate change consistently ranked in the bottom half of issues that matter. Because of all of this, radical change to the way we treat our earth falls on younger generations: millennials and generation z. While it is wonderful that there is still a chance for change, being in the younger and less powerful chunk of the population makes this change challenging. The younger generations have significantly less representation in Congress, no representation in the supreme court and little to no representation in the executive branch. We have the motivation and the knowledge, but time to create change is dwindling and the representatives willing to listen are a minority group. 
<br><br>

Change needs to happen. That is an indisputable fact. Somehow, the older, powerful generations need to side with the younger generations to give power and solutions to an issue that is rapidly worsening.

The fact that change is urgently needed, but looked at as a secondary issue is incredibly frustrating. I also am beyond annoyed at the notion that the older generations created such a massive issue that can potentially eradicate human life, but it is left to the youth to fix it, with no tools or representatives to help. As the election nears, it really haunts me to hear politicians staying silent about the importance of action regarding climate change. Political change is desperately needed to reduce carbon emissions nationwide as a whole, and while I know that a lot of young people have begun to prioritize voting and learned of ways to mobilize people and create a movement, it is terrifying to know that a lot of our efforts will be made futile by the actions of older generations, ultimately dooming us. 
<br><br>


I can't help but wonder what the world would look like if generations before us had chosen to live sustainably, and had listened to the warnings of climate change. Nevertheless, the situation is here. Personally, expecting the youth to stand up to those in power and radically change the Earth's situation, is a big ask. How do people in their twenties go about fixing a problem that was created before they were even born, against the wishes of people that have political power? Why us? Why not you? The youth deserves to bask in ignorance as you did, not be told over and over that "we are the only hope". It is frustrating to see a lack of responsibility and no action taken by Baby Boomers and Gen X's, but they expect us to fix the future of their children and grandchildren.
<br><br>


Maybe it's not the best idea to let the Earth deteriorate to spite those who created the problem, but it does make me upset to see the disregard for the environment. I do believe, however, that some work does need to be done in the older generation. I find a lot of "it's a lost cause"-s when trying to get an answer of why the youth need to do so much urgent, complicated work when the older people just get to sit and literally watch the world burn. If they are the ones with all of the political power, why isn't there a movement among them actively trying to convince others to help? Maybe it's financing or something else, but to me it seems lazy. I just hope that we, collectively, get it together soon.


<br><Hr>
 As I continue to learn more about the climate crisis, it has become even more frustrating for me as well. Although about 70% of voters have finally acknowledged that climate change has been caused by humans, there is still not enough urgency in taking action. When Ken states that the responsibility to save the planet is left to our generation, it makes me nervous, and I agree with Julia that it will be challenging. I feel like now, more than ever, people are obsessed with materialistic possessions. Teenagers eagerly wait for the announcement of the newest iPhone, shop at the most popular brand-name stores, and rely on online companies like Amazon for their everyday needs. We have been raised to crave physical objects, even more so than the previous generation. That being said, our generation is still more likely to take action, especially considering how global warming is ranked less important among older groups and more important to younger ones. Still, I think a lot of the younger generation lacks political efficacy, as shown by how only ⅓ of people from the ages of 18-29 vote. In addition, the younger generation is not represented in high government positions, as Julia mentioned. Since people fail to believe that they can help the climate crisis situation, it becomes even more difficult to instigate a change. However, I do think that intergenerational learning could be beneficial to our society. From personal experience with my parents, I realize the impact that we, even as children, can have.
<br><Hr>

I too feel nervous that the responsibility to save the planet is left to our generation. What will our planet become if we can’t accomplish our goal? It’s very interesting, and very true, how you mention that people now, more than ever, are obsessed with materialistic possessions. Take Amazon for example. Not only do the products being shipped impact our environment greatly, but the packaging used to ship the products also causes great distress on our environment. At least in my experience, Amazon oftentimes separates your one order into several different boxes or uses a huge box to ship a tiny item. They greatly contribute to the waste in our environment, and this is largely due to the materialistic nature of people today. Like Professor Hiltner said, “We need to fundamentally reinvent Western culture, especially consumer culture and the belief that happiness is to be found in the things that we have. It obviously isn’t.” With this goal in mind, we can slowly move towards our goal of mitigating the effects of climate change.

I too love his quiet presentation of an urgent crisis. I believe that some of the solutions he presents are already integrated into this course such as the child to parent mitigation technique. This is done by the release of all content to the public and open lectures for all to enjoy.
